Nulli quantus erat, nulli intus et in cute notus,
Quantus erat notus vix satis ipse sibi.
lit patriae, et saecli doctissimus, omnia norat,

Ignea lingua viro variaque exculta loquela,
Qualis Apostolicas lambere visa comas.
Vita in secessu paulumque severa: nec illum
Ferre mali poterant flierre] nsec} ille malos.
15 Offensus vitiis aevi clam surgit ad astra
Et tanto indignam lumine liquit humum.

V. TO THE REVEREND AND MOST LEARNED THOMAS
FULLER, THEOLOGIAN AND HISTORIOGRAPHER OF
THE MOST EXQUISITE NATURE.

On himself [αἰεί] freed from hond&

This connection of Leeeh with the witty author os the Warthics of England, Holy War,
Charch History of Britain, ete, is most interesting, and is highly creditable to our writer.
‘¹ Next to Shakespeare,” said Coleridge, ¹· Ι am not certain whether Thomas Fuller, beyond all
other writers, does not excite in me the sense and emotion os the marvellous; the degree in
which any given faculty or combination of saculties is possessed and manifested, so far surpass-
ing what one would have thought possible in a single mind, as to give one's admiration the
flavour and quality os wonder.’' Leech in l. 5 alludes to Fuller's great memory. ‘⁸ As proofs
of his wonderful memory it was fabled that he could repeat five hundred unconnected words
after twice hearing thern, ancl recite the whole of the signs in the principal thoroughsaxe of
London after once passing through it and back again ¹' (Chambers's Cyclop. Eng. Lit„ i. 597, 1901).

ARGUMENT.

Father! the Thunderbolt and Flood of Eloquence! whom alone Nescience
escape5‚ either with pen or speech, whose Science is clear in every branch of learn-
ing, whom constant labour crowns together with a retentive memory, to whom to
read is firmly to remember, advise me now what to do, or where to turn me aster
my release. My prison bonds are burst, the bonds of anxiety remain. while 1
wander in this labyrinth give me a clew of your advice. A New Year with storm
and darkness in its train begins! Ah mel how terrible appears the first day os the
year; sadder than ever comes a new year. I had believed the past year set a
period to my cares; Ι had believed sad December past. Yet the plaints Ι send you
on January 1 are the sad plaints of my Muse. Gifts fail, only the dirge remains.

where arn Ι going? Fuller, help me, while my hands are full in visiting my distant
home and country.
