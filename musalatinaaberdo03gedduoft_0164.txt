122 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

M¹Crie gives the date as Aug. 28, 1558 ς he was 82 at death. “ Walter Mill, parish priest
of Lunan in Augus, having been condemned as a heretic in the time of Cardinal Beatoun, had
escaped from execution, and continued to preach, sometimes in private, and at other times
openly, in different quarters os the l—ringdom. Being lately discovered by one of the arch-
bisliop's spies, he was brought to trial at St. Andrews. He appeared before the court so worn out
with age, and the hardships which he had endured, that it was not expected he would be able to
answer the questions which might be put to him; but, to the surprise of all, he conducted his
desence with great spirit '¹ (M‘Crie's Knox, p. ιη). The lines by the Auctor Incertus are
assigned by his son-in-law‚ Thomas VVilson, to Archbishop Patrick Adamson (Pocmata sacra :
London, 1619* Epigrammata, p. 36.)

XIX. ADAM VS HARIOTVS.

Ecclesiaste-5 Aberdonensis, moritur xxiix. Augusti, an. 1574.

Me qui nascentem sacro baptismate tinxti
Te veneror, patrem teque, Hariote‚ colo,
Qui mihi vix puero caelestis praemia vitae
Mousti-asti, et certam celsa sub astra viam.
5 Lilia et has violas, nostri pia pignora cultus,
Haecque pio cineri carmina sacra damus.

ΙΙ.

Qui silvas potuit movere voce
Docta, candidum, anteit, diserta,
Saxa qui potuit ciere flexu

10 Purae, flexaniinae eloquutionis‚
Qui plusquam lapides, ferasve silvas,
Montes quippe hominurn obstinatiores,
Et vinctas adamantinis catenis
Exsecrabilis, horridi tyranni,

15 Circumdueere quivit huc et illuc,
Doctarum decus elegantiarum,
Aut patruni genitor vetustiorum,
Ipse vel genitus patribus vetustis,
Disertissimus Hariotus ille cst.
