THOMAS CARGILL.

Thomas Cargill was elected Rector os the Grammar school, Aberdeen, on Sept. 5, 1580,
in room os the deceased William carmichael. He was succeeded in 1002 by David wedder-
burn and Thomas Reid as Joint-Rectors. Ile was the tencher of (iilbcrt Jack, Thomas
Dempster, Thomas Reid, and David Wedderburn, and enjoyed a wide rtzputation. Meursius
(Atltcnac Batavae, p. 294) refers to him :ts an ‘admirandus iuventutis instruendae artiscx'.

“To Mr. Thomas Cargill, to caus print certant: verse in Latin in commendatione of my
Lord Merchell sor erecking the new Collega in Aberden, at the Counsallis command, 3 lib.''
(Treasurer's Accoums, 1593-3‚ Ssmld. Clnb Miscell. v. 117).

J520 scots voted to Cargill for Poem on The Gowrie Conspiracy (Extracts, Sept. 22. 1601.
Burgh Rccords, ii. 222), “in macking os ane treatise in latin congratulatum his Majestie's
delyverle, conteining some commendatioun of this burghis antiquitie and previlcgcs, grantit
thairunto be his Majestie’s predecessouris, quhilk he dedicat to this burght ”. For the order of
the day, on Aug. 5, 1601, the anniversary os the Gowrie Conspiraey‚ see Munro's Aldcrmsn
and Provosts (1897), p. ¹25·

Thomas Dempster (Hist. Eccl. i. 173) notes under his name: “Thomas Cargillus,
Scholae Aberdonensis praefectus, vir literatissimus, primae meae iuventutis institutor. Scripsit
Poematum libros, et Justi Lipsii Dc Constantia libros in linguam Scoticam transtulit. Obiit
anno 1602, hostis haereticorum.'’ The last statement is not very likely, when found in con·
nection with John Johnston.

For the subjoined extracts, in Latin and English verse, Ῑ am indebted to Dr. Joscph
Anderson, Secretary to the Society os Antiquaries of Scotland, Edinburgh, who has transcribe—d
them from vol. xiii. of the Drummond os Hawthornden Manuscripts. The Barclay below is Dr.
William Barclay (q.v.) of Ncpcnlltes same. The reference to Cargill's translation os Hesiod,
issued under the patronage of the Earl Marischal, is remarkable as preserving the record of a
lost book—¹ the more memorable as, isit had been preserved, it might have been considered
the earliest translation of any Greek author by a native os this country'⁷ (David Laing,
Arclzaeologia sualica, iv. p. 71).

Nempe cui a teneris puro de fonte liquores
Contulit in doctos Musa benigna modos,
