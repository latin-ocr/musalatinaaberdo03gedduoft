VIVED ΒΥ HIS MOST SERENE MAJESTY OF GREAT
BRITAIN, KING JAMES, ΑΝΙ.) CONFERRED IN 1616 ΟΝ
CERTAIN MOST LEARNED ΜΕΝ.

For the trick of James in this apparently innocent procedure, see M‘Crie's Mclville. pp.
336-38 and the notes there. Archbishop Gladstanes requested Jarnes to send him the (orm os
making Bacheiors and Doctors os Divinity‚ ‘¹ to incite others to the same honour and to
encourage our ignorant clergy to learning ''. ‘¹ This object was not¹ however, gained until the
year 1616, aster the death of Gladstanes‚ when Dr. John Young, Dean oi winchester, came to
St. Andrews with the royal instructions, and presided in the first act. His majesty directed
that those who were found qualilied for degrees should ⁸ preach a sermon before the Lords at
Edinburgh, in a hood agre-cing to their degree, that so they might be known (by the Izood or
by the sermon J) to be rnen fitted for the prime places of the Church 'J' Epigram by Leech
(Book iv. p. 85) Ioanni Iunio Vinclzcstrensicnsi Decano. Dr. Young was the sixth son os Sir
Peter Young. joint preceptor with Buclmnan to james VI. 110 was born June 25, 1585, and
educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, In July, 1016, he presided at St. Andrews,
when the principals of the three colleges and other ministers were created Doctors os Divinity.
He again visited Scotland in 1615 to assist in carrying through the Perth Articles (David
Laing in Row's History, p. 316). It is eurious to lind him addressing these lines to Young
and others, while also corresponding with Andrew Melville the banished ‘⁸ man who had done
more to raise the character of the clergy, in point of literary and theological endowments, than
all the gowned graduates who had filled the academica} chaIrs os Scotland for two hundred
years'’ (M‘Crie, p. 337). For the DD.. St. And„ 1616 of Dr. William Forbes, Rector of
Marischal College, see Rectorial Addresscs (Abdn. 1902), p. 342.

ARGUMENT.

Do the Gramffians, bound but lately in Hyperborean winter, saise their heads
and challenge the stars? W'hy does the Tay exult, why this pride of Clyde and
Esk, and Don that enters the main with its pearly tide ? Certes Apollo as leader os
the band has preferred the men set under the Northern Bear to the land of the
Muses. Here their just meed of glory exalts the Muses, a glory never to perish.
Great King, this is your doing, the new age’s new glory‚ under whose lead the lamb
fears not the Italian wolf, under whom Scotland at one birth has produced so many
distinguished men. Right happy they, born under such a Prince ; happy you, King

James, in such men.
