ARGUMENT.

Light os the Lindsays. ornament of the Muses, right excellent bishop. giving
law in holy things to my scllow townsmen os Montrosc, to whom Dundee, native
scat of historian Boccc. and the Esk- rich in salmon, pay their respects; where
Brechin risos, city os the braekcn, where the tower os Mar rises on its own modest
hill; who have in your rulc Arbroath with its sad sacred ruins, and Forfar the
‹lelight os kings of old: I congratulati: you that these titles are added to your
deserts, worthy as you were before of such a high name. Why do we still complana
of blind Fortune? In this case certainly she had her eyesight and was no blind
Goddcss.

XXI. DAVlDl LYNDESIO, EPISCOPO BRECHINENSI.

Lyndesidum iubar, Aonidum decus, optime praesul,
Qui Celurcanis das sacra iura meis,
Quem patria historici Taodunum terra Boethi,
Quem salmone ferax nobilis Esca colit:
5 Qun filicum urbs surgit de nomine dicta, Brechinum,
Qua turris modico Marria colle tumet :
Cui stat Aberbrothea sacris miseranda ruinis,
Et veterum regum Forsara delitiae:
Gratulor hos meritis titulos accedere vestris,
10 Ut qui olim tanto nomine dignus eras.
Et quid adhuc caecae querimur vim sortis iniquam?
Hic certe vidit, nec dea caeca suit.
