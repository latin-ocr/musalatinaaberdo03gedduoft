Ι. THE DIADEM AND THE MITRE, OR THE RETURN OF
DAPHNIS AND THE DRUIDS.

A pastoral in the hackneyed and imitative vein. with the Theocritean and Virgilian stage-
properties much worn and now sadly “dilapidated de'bris of artificial Arcadianism,'' as Mark
Pattison (Milton, p. 41) calls it. The Druids are, of course. the restored bishops. The Re-
scissory Act had effaced the last twenty-eight years, and the Privy Council lost no time. ¹⁴ In
the ecclesiastical revolution Sharpe had been a principa] agent. Minister os Craill in Fifev
he had identified himself with the Resolutioners. and had successfully represented their in-
terests with Cromwell, Monk, and Charles. In March. 1661, he had written: ‘But if a
change (os church government) corne, Ι make no question it will be grievous and bring on
suffering upon many honest men, in which I would be very loath to have any hand! but by
December he was Archbishop of St. Andrews and primate of Scotland. . . . Its (Parliament's)
first Act re-admitted the bishops to its sittings, and its third restored thern to their accustomed
dignities, privileges, andjurisdictions ’' (Hume Brown, History of Scoil11nd‚ii,386‚ 387). ¹¹ Once
a Resolutioner and therefore bound to the Covenants, he had betrayed the cause which he had
been expressly chosen to represent, and had been the prime agent not only in the setting up os
Erastian Episcopacy but in all the severities which sor eighteen years had been directed
