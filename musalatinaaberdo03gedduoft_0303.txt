J011N Lmen. 253

that usually well-informed wanderer on the Scot Abroad has a singularly significant passage
in the Ilislor. lici-les. ii. 443, ed. Irving. He has this explicit statement: “joannes Leon-liaeus
Duci 'l'remolio nuper inscripsit poema. cui titulum fecit Πίσης Kalendis Maii, lib. i. ; Dc ὅρι’,
Epos lib. i. Contra lipiscopos Scotos Satyram, quo nomine exilio multatus. Vivit in Galliis,
et Musae praesidiis relegationem „solarum” Dempstcr appears somewhat mixed over the writ-
ings, but his statements explain the facts at least. His clu: appears true, and possibly, as
we have conjectured on Ncmcsis Poetica, 241, it was the sterce attaek on :chhbishop Spottis-
woode that may have been the cause os his trouble. lt was certainly ιι subject least of all
pleasing to his royal creator, who had treated Leech's townsman, Andrew Melville, in the
same manner sor his criticism of bishops.

We can thus trace him bacltwards and sorwards iri France and Scotland up to 1620. We
know that he bade sarewell, a lasting one he believed, to France on 1st May, 1620 (Epig. iv.
p- 95)-

⁴‘ Gallia cara vale, nostrae gratissima vitae,
Forte iterum haud oeulis aspicienda ineis . . .
sed tamen. ut totos rapias mihi candida oceIIOS.
Carior est animo &cotia fusca meo.''

He lest behind him in Paris his friend George Chalmers, and to him he speaks oftroubles
at home (p. 94) :—-

¹⁸ Verum me, Camerari, abire tandem,
Atque hanc Sequanicam relinquere urbem,
lit te Sequanicfr mihi vel urbe,
Et te his iam mihi cariorem ocellis,
Invitum licet, et parum volentem,
Cogunt proli patriae domus procellae.‘'

But much new light has been found on Leeelt in the correspondence which he maintained
with Scot of Seotstarvet. A very careful transcript has been made, for the purposes os this
volume, of the Latin letters preserved in the Advocates' Library‚ Edinburgh (MSS. 17, 1, 9),
and the result may be thus stated.

From some unmentioned place in February, 1617. he writes to say that he hzxd had before
but poor hopes os the Mala ancl the Spes, but Scot's good opinion of thern had rather brought
him round to his srieml's side.¹ From London, November 19, 1617, he is eager to be off sor
France. Nemesis, as edited by Scot, he has received, and asks that letters be addressed for the
winter to him at the University of Paris, He had thought of a dedication to Pembroke, but
those English were now Qff the Latin (Latiam barbiton abhorrent), and so he had thought of
Chancellor Seton. He signs himself ⁴·Tuissimusf‘ like Thomas Heywood (Cunningham’s
Marlawc, p. So). From Paris', January 31, 1618, he sends the lines beginning “Quam Iegis
hacc ismff' and wonders how his ‘¹ ammnlus '¹ and his imbecille corpus ct aursurrnm ” can stand

¹This play on words is almost certainly taken from the concluding lines of Buehanan's
courtly dedication os the Psalms to Queen Maryt—

¹⁴ Non tamen ausus eram malr natum exponere foetum,
Ne mihi displiceant quae placuere tibi.
Nam quod ab ingenio domini sperare nequibant,
Debebunt genio forsitan illa tuo.“
