ARGUMENTS.

1.

Heliodorus was a Phoenix and reared his own funeral pilei Lo, Sidney, thou
risest from the fragrant ashes, with ages yet in store for thee.

11.

Heliodorus saw Sidney from Elysium. “ Ι rejoice Britain bore you. Were you
read in Greek, no need for my story of Chariclca.’¹

111.

Aristarchus, the critic, balancing both books7 says: “Heliodorus is less than
Sidney‚ just as Pyrocles excels the Aethiopian ''.

1V.

Atropos with her own hand laid down the fixed order of the poets—Homer‚

virgil, the next a bad third. Sidney died before his time, lest he should invert the
order of all.

V.

Nature, dowering Sidncy with universal gists, refused the blame of his death.
Death snatehed him. '‘ Afterthis,'' says the overwhelmed parent, “ 1 have resolved not
to lose so much in onc.''

V1.
Death, (lepriving ata blow an ungratesul world os Sidney, says: “1 rejoice in
my spolia opima. All the rest sor long before were plebeian.’'
Vll.

Sidney is a proofthat our wits are not inferior to Greece or Rome. One wit-

ness, you will say, may not prove this. But one that demonstrates it will be
enough.

1.

Heliodorus erat Phoenix, fessusque senecta
Eineritusque sibi struxerat ipse rogum;

Ecce ab odorata surgis, Sydnaee, favilla,
Debentur formae pluria saecla tuae.

11.
5 Sydnaeum Elysiis conspexit ut Heliodorus,
Laetor, ait, quod te terra Britanna tulit.
Si Graius totum vates legerere per orbem,
Nostra Charicleae fabula muta foret.
