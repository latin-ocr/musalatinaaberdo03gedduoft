JOHN JOHNSTON. 130

IX.

Wimam Keith, brother of George Keith, Earl Marisehal; unfortunately
killed near Geneva, July 24, 1577.

Gcncva welcomed me with an embrace after crossing so many lands and scas.
Nevcr loss did she so bewail: the Lake of Geneva has water enough sor tcars.
Fathcr and brother sparo your tcars. No place nearer than this from which to
rcach heaven.

X.
wmiam Keith, Earl Marischal 1V., grandfather of George‚ Earl Marischal V.
Dicd, after surviving son and grandson, 7th Oct. 1581.
You seemed by your calm mind, your peaeeful old age and means equal to the

shock os envy. But good and evil are blended. You see two deaths. No man's lot
is happy till the closing turn of the wheel of fortune.

XI.

James Stewart, Earl of Moray. attacked and killed, aster the burning of his
house near the Forth, Feb. 6, 150²·

Α hero of the kind such as bards describe Hector, and a Hercules to the sight,
with gists greater than theirs, did but Fate allow⁴ Nor could the hand of man crush
you. Violence, guile, fire, water, and the eleinents combine. Heaven alone is
open : so the race os fallen angels regains their native sky.

XII.
Sir John Carmichael. Ambushed and slain by a band of Border thieves, the
Armstrongs, when on his way to hold a VVarden Court, June 16, 1600.
Preparing to give justice on the Borders, where Ewes parts England and Scot-

land, by the order of his sovereign‚ a band of reivers slew him by stealth. None so
true to the ways of his country. VVhere now is justice, if it can be thus contemned?

Ι. GRAEMUS.

Custos Regni post interitum Fergusi 11. Regis, generi sui, desperatissimis temporibus, rem
Scoticam fortissime a se defensam felicissime administrat pro Eugenio 11. nepote suo. Ab hoc
Vallum Severi accolae Graemi Vallum usque ad hanc diem vocant. Dedit et hic initium
clarissimae Graemorum Comitum Montis-Rosarum amiliae. Floruit Anno Christi 4²0·

Quisquis es, antiquos seu Britto vindicet ortus,
Scotia seu patrio te terat ore suum ;
Ipse tuus semper, tibi tuque simillimus, idem es,
Teque unum Patriae dicit uterque Patrem.
5 Debet uterque tuis sortem felicibus auctam
Imperiis. Te unum Romulidum arma tremunt.
