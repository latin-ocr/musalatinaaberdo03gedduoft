5. He remembered that he lived not in republica Platonis, but in faece Romuli—nor ‘¹ in
Plato's commonwcalth.¹' but ¹* in the midst of a perverse generatimst* which saying ⁸* hee had

7. Jerusalem, Rome, Antioeh, Alexandria, Constantinople. Much wild talk on this in
the Fam-rats. See David Leech's hyperboles, p. 240, where language os adulation ιο this

XIII. TO HIS MOST LEARNEI) AND MOST RESPECTED
FRIEND, DAVID LEECH, SUB-PRINCII'AL OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEEN.

For the occasion os the lines, see under David Leech and his Philosophia Illachrymans,
1637. Leeeh there, in l. 15, had offered the tears of the University (lamenta Lycaei) to the
Marquis. NVedderbum, in his reply, avails himselfof a conceit, and the lines in Virgil, Ecl.
x. 14, 15, on the lament for Gallus :—

¹¹ Pinifer illum etiam sola sub rupe iacentem
Maenalus et gelidi fleverunt saxa Lycaei,''

with reference to Arcadian scenery. ‘⁸ Old Lycaeus.’' Milton, Arcades. 98. Copied by R. W.
VViIson, Printed Books Department, British Museum.

ARGUMENT.

Did you, rocks of cold Lycaeus, shed such tears (for Gallus)? does Mount
Maenalus itself so dissolve in tears? Here be the tcars, of Niobe, here such a tear-
ful strain as the banished Ovid wrote in hi< Tristi-1. Let hope, Leech, drive away
your plaints. The assured favour of our Patrons begets hope. So 1 think, and
would that rny sportive strain may cheer your dark spirits.
