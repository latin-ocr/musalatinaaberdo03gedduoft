MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Of old the God of Day confessed no view

More gracious to his eye. He left the wave‚
Permessus sacred to the Nine, and drew

Far from Parnassus to the streams that lave
The mouth of Don, and this command he gave

To us that followed after his behest:

“ Behold the kingly pile, the woods that wavc,

The hills in sunshine and green mantlc drest,
'I'hen here where Nature smiles shall be our place of rest.’'

Quickly we bend our steps and grcet the halls,
Ο joy, our Father shews the way! and hail
The hand os Daedalus on our new found walls;
Fair Paris now the Muses may bewail.
For Scine they choosc the Dan, the favouring gale
&Vasts Hector hither with the laurel bays,
Bocee ancl his ever-faithful Hay the tale
Renew of learning from her ancient days,
And thus the ‹lebt of years to Scotland France repays.

While Elphinstone ancl Dunbar here held rule
And Stewart, their mitre was our help and stay.
Long happy years flew by, our horn was full,
With mill< the rivers ran the live-long ἀει-νς
The yellow honcy from the nal< alway
Down dropt. and Ceres of her own accord
Her foison gave, within our hails the lay
Was heard :ind seen around our ample board
'she festal line os light and minstrel‘s answering chord.

Dark was the following time: revolving years

Brought others in their train of altered mind,
Gordon—that fruitsul cause of sin and tears—

Shame flcd the land, nor long Faith stayed behind.
ssut in their place arose the wild and blind

msire of puls, the accursed lust ofg01d3
'l'he gifts of Elphinstone cast to the wind,

chts lost sor ever to the sheep and sold ε
x'et here thy name and praise, John Lesley, shall be told.

O ersing racc! (to tell the tale be ours
As we beheld), inspircd hy 11on zeal‚

And wildest frenzy stirred against the towers
And shrine of l'allasl who with heart to feel
