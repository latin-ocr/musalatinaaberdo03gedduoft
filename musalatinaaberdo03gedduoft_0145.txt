JOHN JOHNSTON. 103

Fergus l„ and duly passing through the extended list. to the reigning monarch, james Vl.:
regarding whom it is worthy of commendatory remark, that the author is moie lavim of
commendatioris on the good fortune which providence had bestowed on him, than on his
talents or kingly qualities. 'l'he ⁸* Heroes'’ i< a tissue of similar epigram& addressed to the
heroes who distinguish the rcigns of the same line of kings. commcncing with Ferchard‚ the
great commander-in-chief of King Reuther. Of course, both works laud the virtues of many
men who never drew breath. The merits of John-<ton as a classical poet cannot be said to fise
beyond those of the mere epigrammatist: to the classica! ela-gance of his Latinity we believe
few objections ean be found, but he displays more of the neatness of illustration, and precise
aptness os association, which may be taught, than of the inborn poetica] fire; and his works
are perhaps more pleasing in the restrictions of a classic tongue than they might have been had
he allowed himself to range in the freedom of his vernacular language. When treating those
who never existed, or of whom little is known, the absence of all interest from the subject
adds to the coldness of the epigram, and leaves room for the mere conceit to stand alone; hut
in treating of interesting or striking events, Johnston could sometimes be lofty, and hit a
chord of feeling. We might instance, as favourable specimens, the epigram to the family of
the Frasers, massacred by the Clanranald in 1544. and that to Robert the Bruce.''—Chambers’
Biog. Dict. s.v.

joseph Robertson (Biog. Abrcdon. iii. 149) quotes from a MS. in the Advocates' Library
Johnston's own dying epitaph: “Sub beata spe ResurrectioniS Johannes Johnstonus, S.
Theol. Professor, cum imbecilla valetudine diu multumque conflictatus, mortalitatis suae
memor spemque vivam immortalitatis fide in Jesum Christum Dominum atque Sei-vaterem
unicum intuens, hoc sibi epitaphium moriens fecit:

Martia dat vitae lucem, cultumque tenello
Ingenio, Christum dat quoque nosse mihi.

Altera mi patria est Germania ; quae fovet, auget
Artibus ingenium, religione animum.

Bis peragrata mihi est animosa Helvetia: sanctis
Instruit exemplis clara Geneva fidem.

Anglia languentem patriae me reddit, ut ista
Mi vitam et cathedram, redderet et tumulum.

Si quis ego, ah, siquis, tua laus est unica, Christe,
Quodque tuus vixi, quodque tuus morior.''

recalling Arthur Johnston by name, who had in the Buchanan-Eglishem dispute been the
defendet of the older poet.

Nunc tu qui fortes animas, belloque peremptas
Heroum regumque canis, celebrabere [ola.
Nomine te referens, comes ibit vindice canna,
Pro Corydone ferox, Onopordi nobilis hostis.
