JOl-IN LEECH.

The life of this most interesting man isinvolvedin considerable obscurity. The reasons are
biographical and bibliographical, and absolute confusion has hitherto attended every effort
published. He was early confused with his brother David. and the statements made about the
brothers have for the most part been a mere hurried compilation from title pages, as in the
articles in the Dice. Nat. mog. 'l'hat he was connected, as there suggested, with the Leech
family of Carden in Cheshire, is, as we have seen in the case of his brother David. absolutely
erroneous. His references to his native place and to Scozland are as numerous as they are
precise and leave us in no doubt as to xhis particular. Other persons of the same name have
been inextricably mixed up with him.

john Lecch was the son of the Rev, Andrew Leech of Montrose, and was educated at the
Grammar School of his native place under David Limlsay, afterwards Bishop of Brechin.
Jervise (Laud «gf thc Lindsqu, pp. 250-53) states this, adding that his mother's name was
Collace. and that the Leech family was connected with a burgess branch of the name at
Montrose. The selections from his works have been arranged :ts far as possible in chronological
order, and in the various introductions aud notes will be found all the elucidations that at this
date can be made with certainty or at least with some assurance. He entered King’s College,
Aberdeem in 1610, and graduatecl in ¹⁶¹⁴· The next steps in his career it is impossible to
trace with precision. as we fi ld him inentioning his wanderings in England and France. He
seems also to have been acquainted with lreland from his frequent references to the Bann and
the Suir. and he addresses the fifth of his Ecloguc Vinitoriac to George Montgomery‚ ¹· Epis-
copo Medcnsi ct Clophor.'' That he was of good family and widespread social con-
nections is clear froin the long list of those whom he addresses, apparently on terms of
easy intimacy. He has two epigrains to John :tnd Robert Baton, his consobrini (Epig. i. 19,
“not in good taste? Musa. i. 250). meaning Robert Baron. the ‘¹ Aberdeen Doctor,'' and his
brother John, the Principnl os St. Salvador's College, St. Andrews, for whose family see the
Life os Dr. John Forbcs‚§42 in the 1702-3 Ainsterdam edition of his works, and Sibbald's
History of Fifc. 1803, p. 4²7· ln lines to Patrick Maule of Panmure, of the King's Bed-
chamber (Epig. iv. 78). he says :—

“ Materno veniens sanguis nos stemmate, Malli,
Iunxit, Areskinae germina bina domus.‘’

This Maulc, first Earl ol' Panmure, was· the son of Patrick Maule of Panmure. Forfarshire‚
and Margaret Erskine, a daughter os John Erskine of Dun, the reformer. It is, of course,
hazardous to draw inferences· with perfect security from his dedicamus and epigrams, but in
his 1620 voume we find him on a footing of more or less assured intimacy with Arthur John-
ston‚ the Earl of Montrose, George Villiers, Marquis of Buckingham. James Hay, Viscount
Doricaster, Sir Robert Ayton, William Herbert, 1211} of l'embroke, Chancellor Alexander Seton,
