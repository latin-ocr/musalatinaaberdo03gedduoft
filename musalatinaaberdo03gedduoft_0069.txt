DE EODEM.

Magnum virtutis fuerat documenta dedisse,
Illustrasse magis, sed coluisse magis

Heroes quantum vates cessere priores,
CARoiisLo quantum cedit et Hesiodus;

Voce Mariscallo tantum concedit uterque:
Exprimit ille actis nam quod uterque docet.

With wyse rnen then remaining into (ji-cccc.
To worthic Plato, where he wes intombde

Unto his image, which unto all men's eyes
This dittone bure ingravet] in the same:

VVhom eve-rie one with on-ing beart should aymo,
As famous guide who auglit eternall same,
'l'o imitate his vei-tue and commend
His quick ingyne, that live may make his name
From age to age unto the latter end 2 ”

In Britain iloto have eternall praise.

ANOTHER TO THE SAME.

As Philip’s sonne of Macedon the king,
And mightie monarch of the wordle haiil,
Whili in impyre he royallie did regne,
In hie estate, not feeling Fortunis fain,
In sentence had the accusatioune
Of Aristone, the prudent prince and waill
Of sapience and witt of most renoune,
VVheresore he laid his Acroase ¹ so dounc

¹ Acroase, lecture.
