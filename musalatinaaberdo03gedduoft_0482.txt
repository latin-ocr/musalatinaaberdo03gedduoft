XVI. SIGHS OF DAVID WEDDERBURN AT THE DEATH
OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON,1³HYSICIAN TO THE KING,
AND EASILY FlRST POET OF HIS AGE.

Λ pleasant memorial os the listy years' sriendship os the two men. It is not very clear
whether Wedderburn means to reser the spread by Johnston of Buchanan's same to the rival
version of the Psalrns or, as is perhaps the case, to his long and laboured participation in the
Eglishem quarrel, over that preposterous person's sels-advertisement in the rendering of
l'salm civ. (Musa. i. pp. 14„ 50). As Burton notedy Johnston's challenge in the rival version
os the Psalms was one ·‘ upon every linc, otherwise he had no excuse sor offering to the world
a different one,'' and ‘⁴ his same was afterwards irretrievably injured in the house os his
friends by an attempt to list him sar above his master,'' in the editions of Auditor Benson
remembered by the lines in the Dzmciad, 4, 110. Hallam decides that ¹⁴ though the national
honour may seem equally secure by the superiority of either. it has been usual in Scotland
to maintain the older poet against all the world. l am nevertheless inclined to think that
johnston's psalms¹ all os which arc in elegiae metre. do not fall short os those os Buehanan.
either in elegance os style or in correctness os Latinity'' (Liternturc, ch. xxii. §72). John-
ston's fame would have been higher in Scotland il Laud for political reasons had not imposed
upon him the rival version to discredit the author os the De Jurc Regni. Certainly the
dedication of the Seven Penitential Psalms to Laud in 1633, and his reference to that patron‘s
pictas :ind acinum caelestis ingenii, do not add to his reputation.
