JOHN VAUS.

This is the oldest contributor to the Aberdeen Latin Muse. ¹⁴ Little is known os the
writer. The exact date of his appointment to King’s College has not been ascertained. We
may hazard the guess that he was perhaps a descendant of ‘John the Waus' (im. John os
the WVaHs, de Vallis ?), Alderman of the City in 14444445, one of whose sons bore the name
of John, and another Riehard, bestowed in 1469 on the Holy Friars their place in Bromi
Street. The Town Council Registers record that in 1520, Sir John Waus, Chaplain os the
Altar os Jesus (in St. Nicholas Church), became possessed of a tenement. The title and
office mark him as a priest. Probably he studied at Paris, if, as seems probablc, Aberdeen was
his native city ‘¹ (Simpson‘s Bon-lemni, p. 101). The name in mediaeval documents‚ figures
as de VaHibus, De Vaulx, the Vaus, or Waus. In Aberdeen about 1420 the name was com-
mon in deeds and transfers (Mumo, Abiorum and Provosts, p. 31). On the name, see scon,
Talisman, ch. vi.: ‘¹ called by the Normans the Lord de Vaux, and in English, by the Saxons.

of Aberdeen Latinity, see Abcrd. Quat. Studies, pp. 387-389; and for sketch, see Delisle's
Josse Bade cl Jmn Vaus, 1896.

‘⁸ Vaus paid a visit to Paris in 1522 sor the purpose os publishing a grammatical work, and
he speaks os his journey as being attended ‘with the greatest risks by land and sea, and
dangers from unscrupulous pirates¹’' (Hume Brown's Eudamum, p. 26). Plura in Scottislz

From Boece's Murthlacensium Et Abcrdoncnsinm Episcopormn Vittz‘. Paris, 1522. For
the book, see Abcrd. Qitatcr. Studics, Bibliography‚ p. 357. verses 1-16 may be anonymous:
or, with the last six lines, they may be also by Vaus. The bridge refers of course to the
Bridge of Dee (see Moir's Bocce, p. 122 and Appendix D).

ARGUMENT.

Fellow-lovers of learning, to whom I bequeathed this house to be a memorial of
my regard, you in lise I cherished‚ my mind was ever with you, Ι thought it dear
ever to rcgard you as mine. In life I remember you, and the Fate cannot make me
unmindful of you. Lest any of you should feel my loss, my Soul is in heaven and
my bones with you on «earth. Do you, then, who alone remain remember in turn
my fatherly love.
