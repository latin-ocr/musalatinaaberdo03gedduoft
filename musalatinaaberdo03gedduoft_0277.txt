There the mutter seems to have dropped (see Baillie's Lettm‘s and Journals, Edinb. 1842,
iii. pp. 554, 555, cd Laing, and Clmmbers' Cycl. ling. Lite-r. (1901) i. pp. 503, 515.)

Os the date of his death nothing is known. Sir Thomas Urquhart (vach Lond. 1652,
p. 199) notiees him: “l l'orbear to spend encomiums upon that worthy gentleman Master
David Leech, who is a most fluent poet in the Latin mugile, an exquisite philosopher, and
prolound Theolog. Seeing that I arn come to speak againe os Scotish poets which have
flourished of late. the forcsaid Master Leech hath an elder brother named john, who harh set
forth four or five most excellent books os Κρίῳ-111113 and Eclogues in the l,atin.'' ln the 1035
Funcrals, besides the Allegorta, he has an Oratio ffumlnis, and a prefatory Latin letter ιο
Dr. John Forbes. The Latin style in prose, os the work and of the whole period, while highly
correct is flowery and strained. The note os the Humanists has been replaced by a pulpiteer-
ing and declamatory vein, which, though possibly in kecping with the subject, raises doubts as
to its sincerity.

Ι. ΑΝ ALLEGORY, IN WHICH THE RIGHT REVEREND
BISHOP (PATRICK FORBES) IS DULY COMPARED TO
PALINURUS, AND THE UNIVERSITY TO A SHIP, BY
DAVID LEECH SUB-PRINCIPAL OF THE UNIVERSITY,
PROFESSOR OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY AND LOWER
MATHEMATICS.

This vigorous and well-written Allegory by Leech, on the basis of the Horatian
Ode 1. xiv„ is full of valuable antiquarian history on the condition of the university
(King's College) at the time os Forbes' death in 1635. It forms the twenty-third
Elegy in the Funerals, whose full title is ‘⁶ Funcrals ol* a Right Reverend Father in
God, Patrick Forbes of Corse, Bishop of Abel-dene. Τοῦ ἐν ἁγίοις Reverendissimi in
Christo Patris Patricii Forbesii a Corse, Episcopi Aberdoniensis, Tumulus Aber-
dene. Imprinted by Edward Raban‚ 1035.'⁷ This work contains funeral sermons
by the “ Aberdeen Doctors‚’' Dr. Robert Baron‚ Dr. Alexander Scrogie, Dr. Alexander
Ross, Dr. James Sibbald, Dr, John Forbes, and others, with severity-four Elegies
in Latin and English verse. and is a well-known source of information on the
ecelesiastical life of Scotland from 1618 to 1635.

The portrait therein drawn of Bishop Patrick Forbes has been followed and
accepted too literally by succeeding writers. Forbes was responsible, more than any
other individual, for the cast given to the town and district in matters ecelesiastical
and civil, and for the troubles that beset Aberdeen all through the period dealt with
by the local ehronicler, Spalding, in his Menwrialls. 'she an’ruls is the deliberati.-
