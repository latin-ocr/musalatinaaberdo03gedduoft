Father, to whom I was more ‹Iearthan lise itsels, while every votary os heaven and
every lover of virtue vies. in honouring your funeral; while bishops‚ nobles, the
pcoplc, the academie band regret your 1055, while they complain that 1110 flower os
the racc os Forbcs has passed away, that the counscllor os Kings and 1115 country‘s
pride 1135 died, that the tloek has lost 115 shcpberd‚ the clergy their guido, that his
tieryeloquence 15 1111511011; νν111Ιο 1110 University wails its founder, that the Muses
have 1051 their Phtebus and learning 115 patron; while the pulpit, 50011011 resonant
with your utterancc, groans draped in blaek, and the wail goes round the streets;
while the thunders os the city guns lire the air and the ery ot* the people's love strikes
the welkin—in all this no one grieves for you, but each for himself and country.
Seeing 11115, what 1111151 I think? While 1 recall your strong love, your features,
your gestures, your learning, your prayers, your heroic and patriarchal death, that
it was given to nie to 01050 your eyes in death and pay you the last 11105, what more
1011131115 for your sorrowful 5011 and dear relations ? What but to celebrate strongly
the Father of all, the author of such good, who will grant things still greater, when
the last truinpet shall summon forth the dead srom their graves, and shall restore
body to soul. Let them strive 10 follow you on the way above. Such 15 the 1055011
taught 115 by the death of the 5311115. God gave you, and God took you, let Heaven
and Earth praise God without end. Flecting under the sun are the joys. of 11115
world. Heaven, our home, grants riches everlasting. Happy hc to whom Graec
grants the race, and glory the goal. Be mine such a life and death.

Dulce decus, genitor, vitali suavior aura,
Luminis usura cui mage carus erarn :

Durn tua condecorant certatim funera quisquis
Numen amat, virtus et cui clara placet,
