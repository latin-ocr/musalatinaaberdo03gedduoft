manifesto osan ecclesiastical faction, and the censures passed on Principal David
Rait (1592—1632) should be carefully considered in this light. Shand, the editor of
the Funerals for the Spottiswoodc Society in 1845, and who cannot be accused os
indifferenee to the memory of Forbes or his party, has at least seen that the object
of the Bishop was to convert the University into a stronghold of a Section os the
Episcopalian Church of the day. The words in his presace‚ pp. lxxvii-viii, present
the case on one side with perfect clearness.

“As may readily be supposed, the general state os the two Universities situated
within his Diocese engaged much os the attention and solicitude of the Bishop.
King's College was founded by his predecessor, the munificent Bishop Elphinstone‚
in 1494, and Marischal College was erected in 1593 froin the spoils os religious
houses in Aberdeen, in this instance applied to purposes far more useful and laud-
able than was generally the case. By the original constitution of King¹s College, as
framed by its pious founder, the Bishop, the Dioccsan, was the Chancellor and
supreme (jovernon to whom were committed the care of choosing and admitting the
Proscssors, the disposal of the revenues, and the direction and order of the studies.
Forbes on his promotion to the See, found everything connected with this University
in a very neglected state—the buildings hastening to decay and ruin, the rents and
income os the College dilapidated, the statutes neglected, several of the Professor-
ships. altogether fallen into disuse‚ the Professors careless in the performance os their
(tunes, and the whole liberal arts and sciences‚ for the promotion of which Bishop
Elphinstone had so zealously laboured, almost unknown and expired. The Bishop‚
with great prudence and discretiori, proceeded to remedy these abuses, and to restore
the L'nive1·sity to its former honour and dignity. He recovered and enlarged the
revenues‚ he repaircd the magnificent buildings left by Elphinstone, he restored the
l'rofessorships which had been allowed to sall into decay, he caused the old and
admirable statutus of the founder to be enforced‚ and by his own example and au-
thority the Professors were rcminded of and urged to the performance ol their duties.
By the original constitution of the University it was mainly designed for the educa-
tion of the elergy, and the Bishop took carc tlmt this object, :crhich lic had so much at hcart,

which the Regents or Teachers os Philosophy having studied under the Primarius
Professor os'l'hcology were obliged, at the expiry of six years to leave the University,
whenever it appeared to the Bishop that the good os the Church or University
required it, and undertake the charge of parochial cures, giving place to others,
in course os training sor the work of the ministry. This excellent statute, which
during his life the Bishop caused to be carefully observed, was afterwards allowed to
fall into desuetude. Whenever the cure of any parish within the Dioeese became
vacant, hc selected from the Regents the onc who appeared, by his piety and learn-
ing, the best fitted for the situation, filling up his place in thc college from among
the most promising of the students. By this method, so successsully was the good
ol' the Church promoted, so effectually were all negligence and sloth on the part of
the Regents premnted, and proper encouragement given to the piety and diligence
