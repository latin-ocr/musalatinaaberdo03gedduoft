XXXI.

John Bury. first a minister of the church at Edinburgh, then at Montrose,

died on the 29th of Feb. 1600.
Having suffered exile in his own country, he feels not for that but sor its losses.
Secing everywhere the tide ebb, he preferred to be far from city and court. In exile

he found a country and rest. Montrose gave him life and a grave. Could it give
more ?

While the fathers and brethren from every quarter hasten to Montrose to dis-

cuss the office of a true bishop, Dury, despising its human mles, is claimed sor the
eompanies of heaven.

XXXII.
Robert Pom, the venerated minister os St. Cuthbert's, Edinburgh, famous
for his divine writings, died May 8, 1606.
Am I summoned again to wecp and wast, and will there be no end to my
plaints? 'I'hough you may be said to have lived long enough. is one compute by

years and grey hairs. the activity os mind and body would suffice for an endless
number of years.

(2·)

On the same I’ont; who, while he reckons the times and the yea1·s,adjusting the
weeks of Daniel, withdraws himself from human affairs, following the noble example
of Cn. Vibius in Pliny.

While hc counts and balances the times, time passos, the brief hour flies,
Libitina culs his thread. XVisely shun prying into the seerets of destiny. God
thought fit: Ile rules all: enough.

XXXIII.
wmiam Erdius‚ collcague of Robert l'ont, from a stone cutter rising to be a
noteworthy preaeher; who beginning studies late, sels-taught in Latin,
Greek, and Ammaic, and beeorning wondrously skilled thercin, died 1606.

Harmonious spirits, united in love and in care for the floek. Death removes
l'ont first, Erdius quiekly follows. In vain death pre-pares to part the two; in
heaven the tie os friendship is only the closer.

E caelo alluxit primam Germania lucem
Qua Lanus, et vitreis qua fluit Albis aquis.
Intulit hinc lucem nostrae Dux praevius orae.
O felix terra! hoc si foret usa duce 1
