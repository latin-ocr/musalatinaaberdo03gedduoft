the benefit os the mineral waters.'' ¹

There he was supported by the Countessos Errol : thence he removed to Aberdeen. There
he died in the spring of ¹745· and was buried in the Spital Churchyard. John Skinner‚ author
os ⁸⁶ Tullochgorum.'’ wrote an epitaph for a monument proposed to be erected to his memory,
but never set up. The spot, accordingly, is unknown. The character os Meston appears from
his works. ‘¹ He was possessed of an uncomrnon fund of wit and humour, in the timing os which
he had a peculiar art. These shone in their fullest lustre when over his botsse, to which he
seldom had any reluctance. On these occasions it was impossible for the most phlegmatic dis-
position to continue live minutes in company with him without being ready to split his sides.
His jokes were always ιὶ propos, and he had a singular knack in telling a story. Satire was
liis natural weapon, which was very poignant, and which he studied chiefly to imitate Butler,
whose cast os mind was very similar to his.'‘
