JAMES KENNEDV. ¹75

King, our muse in ‹lcpcndancc on you follows the shisting changes. os your face.
With you as our ruler, O high-born son of Jamcs the Peuce-makes, Ι shall begin to
wake the tyre. The bard of Andes shall straightway pour the straun, and Virgil's
pipo shall sing your deeds. who is worthier to recall them in fit tragne style than
the singcr os the Man of Troy?

To 'rim Remu-21³.

Kind render, you justiy ask why 1 have sung a song on the pipo os the Roman
singer, or why, in recalling the exploits of Scotland‘s king, Ι venture in touching
Virgil's lyre. The reason is readily given. My powers extend to but a limited field, his
was the work osa ripe genius. Charles's famous exploits must bc sung in high-sounding
style, worthy as they are of the Roman song-god‘s stram. Mv brow is not erowned
with the laurcl of Parnassus, Phoebus has not granted me the lyre of Achilles ; what
singer ean worthily sing Chanes, whom do the nine Muses so richly favour? Charlcs's
fame is fit for Virgil's tongue. Charles is the giory of kings, as Virgil is of ponis.

ARGUMENT.

Here great Chanes, inferior to none in piety, recaliing by his name and couragc
his famous sire, gives the signal for war against the rebellious son of Brutus (the
Englishman). Surrounded with his Scottish soldiers. he hastens against the foc.
A battle is fought. The King sends to the shades right many a corpse. The sons
of the Grampians sti-ive to show their bravery by deeds3 leaders fall, and the name-
less mass of combatants. At last victory declares for the robber chief and superi<
ority of numbers. Then the King, seeing all over, escapes by the guidance 01 God
through the armed foe, and lurking awhile in Englandy is compelied to seek exile in
various lands abroad. First he sails for France, then enters Germany, thence¹ a
welcome guest to Flanders. Finally Holland receives him, and hither the ssritis-‚h <tuly
send chosen men to ask his return and pardon. He returns and enjoys the throne
and sceptre of his ancestors, then sends for a bride from the race of Portugal. Then
a lasting marriage treaty is made, and Hymen with great applause sings the strain.
