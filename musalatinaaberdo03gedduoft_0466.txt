This poem by wedderburn is remarkable sor showing the belief that was still everywhere
accorded to the national legend and the antiquity os the race os Scottish kings. Whatever
religious differences separated Scotsmen since the Reformation, on this point at least there
was none. Prote-<tant and Catholic. and particularly the Scot abroad. combined in the belief
and assertion os the antiquity which lest the proudest royal house< os Europe, and the very
Papacy its-clf, sar behind. Thr: position of the Scottish xnonarchy in Europe was greatly
strengthened by the suppose] antiquity, and its poverty was completely evershadowed by the

(Chalmers's Life os Ruddimau, 1794), the work was presaced by Ruddiman's Tabula Chrono-
