VIII. IOHANNES WILLOCVS.

Obiit in Anglia.

Cum patriae implessem donis caelestibus urbes,
Mille olim obiiciens mortibus hanc animam,
Ipsa adeo exultat caeli sic luce sereni,
l'aene sibi ut caelum et lux queat esse aiiis:
5 Excessi patria laetus tellure, libensque:
Ut vicina istis cresceret aucta opibus.
Hic etiam sevi caelestia semina verbi,
Gensque pia hic nostram plurima sensit opem.
Haec et opes mihi, cumque opibus cumulavit honores,
10 Non secus ac patria me Anglia civem habuit.
Bis civis gemina in patria: mihi tertia restat,
Possidet haeredem tertia sola suum.
