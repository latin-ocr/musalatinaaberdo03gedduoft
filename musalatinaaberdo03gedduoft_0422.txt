372 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

The speakers run riot over Fergus: the repulse os the Romans who never could conquer
Scotland; the Picts ; Banquo and Fleance. This book shows clearly the unhesitating national
belief in the national legend. Boece fairly “ enjoyed his own again '’ that year. At Dundee,
the historian's birth-place, he was greatly eulogised. The king's most happy nativity was
celebrated on 19th June, in the castle of Edinburgh, and at his entry there was delivered ‘⁴ ane
Hebrew speach by Andrew Ker a boy of nyne yeeres age ”. Alexander the Great was remem-
bered by Stirling. “Mucii is recorded in the Calendars of Fame of that Macedonian con-
queror, Alexandcr; and not without cause perhaps was hee entitled (irent, but his violence
and pryd (like deep skarres in a wel proportioned face) were staynes unto his other qualities.''
l'erth rejoiced at the awful sight, ¹¹ by which VVee, who these many yeeres by past in absence
of your M. (the sunshyne of our bewtye) did sitt lyke so many Gyrasolcs languishing in the
shads of darkness, may now againe lyke als manie Lizards delyte our selfes in the sight of
your gracious countenance ”.

Aberdeen, except by Wedderburn. is unrepresented. At St. Andrews, Henry Danskin
(⁴⁴ Civitatis Andreanae orator et juventutis ibidem moderator,'⁷ Brougham's ‘Schoolmaster
Abroad '), absorbs six folio pages of a Latin prose harangue. Robert Baton, the ¹¹ Aberdeen
Doctor,'’ has two pages, pp* 216-18. in maintaining these theses before the Monarch (cs.
Forbes' Funerals: ed. Shand, Spottiswoode society, 1845, p. 27) :—

r. An Solum regimen Monarchicum sit naturale?

2. An mulierum et puerorum imperia licita sint ?

3. An homo lumine naturae scire possit mundum a Deo esse Creatum ?
4. An anima rationalis sit ex traduce ?

Baron, whom some people have professed to admire, tells james that he is beyond everything
narrated in Roman history, and then passes to the royal writings against the Church of Rome.
In a style quite recalling the language of Andrew Fairservice in Rob Roy on that topic, Baton
says: ⁴* Vicisti„ profecto Rex invictissime, vicisti illam Eelluam apocalyptieam,¹ illam purpur-
eam Thaidem, illos Romanos Pontifices omni ponto et tempestate feriores'¹. At his books,
“machinae in Musarum castris fabricatae,’' Tiber treinbles, the Po is in trepidationi, and the
Apennines groan aghast! lle concludes with a dest manipulation of Virg. Acn. iv. 20 :—

⁸⁴ Ille meos equidem post sata ingentis Elizac
Mirifice inflexit sensus ”.

The king would strike in with what a liberal saith professed to recognise as rhyme and
reason. The God of the “Aberdeen doctorsf’ and Bishop Patrick Forbes regarded him
(Funerah, p. xliv. ed. 1845) as “ane ange-ll of God.'' broke out with these extraordinary puris
on tlie names of disputants :—

·* As Adam was the first of men, whence all beginning tak:
So Adamson was president. and first man in this Act.
The theses Fair-lic did defend, which thogh they lies contein,
Yet weresair lies and he the same rightsairlic did mainten.
The seild first entred Masxer Sands, and there he made me see
That not all Sands are barren samis ‚· but that some fertile bee.''

¹ ¹¹ While Jesuits and seminary priests were seducing his subjects from their allegiance, and
preparing them for revolt on the first appearance osa foreign soree, he was busy commenting
on the Apocalypsc‚ and demonstrating by arguments drawn from that book that the Pope was
antichrist ” (M‘Crie's Amircw Mclvzllc, p. 135).
