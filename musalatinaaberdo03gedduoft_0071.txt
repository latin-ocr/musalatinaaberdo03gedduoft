Ι. ΙΝ SYNOPSIN HISTORIAE REGUM SCOTIAE
DESCRIPTAM A D. IOH. IONS'I'ONO.

[John Johnston's Inscriptioncs Historicae, Amsteldami, 1602.)

Dum patriam, Ionstone, cupis celebrare vetustam,
In patriam an pecces hac ratione vide.
Forte reus fias. Patriae narn extendere fines,
Hoc faciat civis qui bonus esse velit.
5 Tu contra minuis: breviori ut limite clausa
Hoc uno lateat Scotia tota libro.
Non ergo hic peccas ? Sed pro te dicere fas est,
Iudicioque operam sistere iure tuam.
Historiam ut patriam memoras atavosque retexis,
10 Scotica queis olim sceptra tenere datum ;
Hic patriae fines studio meliore propagas,
Orbi ut iuncta tuo terra Britanna stylo.
Spargit enim sese gentes diffusa per omnes,
Et toto per te clarior orbe nitet.
