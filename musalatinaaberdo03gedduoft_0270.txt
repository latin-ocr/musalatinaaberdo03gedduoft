ARGUMENT.

Hail, thou Muses' pillar, thou son known to the mother from an unknown shore.
Anxious whether heaven or earth held you, 1 wake asresh the shell of Arion. Our
band salutes thee. the walls ιεκεῖ thee, the library sings thy bounteous hand. The
heliotrope no more truly follows the sun than your star refrcshes our lilies. So long
as our pot with its comcly triad flourishes, your glory, Reid, shall stand with it.

Salve Thespiadum columen, lux splendida; salve
Matri ex ignoto cognite nate solo.

Anxia iampridem caelumne solumne teneres,
Nuper Arioniam pulso repulso chelyn.

5 Nostraque Musophilmv te psallit turba, salutant

Moenia, munificum bibliotheca canit.

Solsequium Phoebum non plus sectatur amoenum,
Quam tua stella micans lilia nostra rigat.
