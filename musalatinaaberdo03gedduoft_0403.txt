The immortal Amaranthus, princely Rose.

Sad Violct, and that sweet Flow’r that bears

In Sanguine Spots the Tenor of our Woes,

Spread on this Stone, and wash it with your Tears..
Then go and tell from Gades unto Inde,
You saw where Earth's Perfections were confm’d.

ARGUMENT.

Has the hope of the realm fallen, have our foes ceased to sear? Avaunt, song
and dance. Come hither, Melpomene, and pour the tears worthy of such a prince-
Ye Muses, let her be your leader in the wail. Of old you foretold all happiness to
the child, but hope and fact are gone. The expected day drew nigh on which the
nymphs bare their individual stoi-e of gifts to the Prince. From you and from the
