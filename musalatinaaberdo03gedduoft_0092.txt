52 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

1 boast of my high tlescent. Buchan of old has obeyed their rule, and so has
ssanff on its modest hill, and the Deveron known to Dempsters for five centuries·
There is my stately mansion, there stand the battlemcnted walls ς there the titles of
my sires, and many a retainer after the manner of the country. Perhaps the
monareh’s hand is niggard, and the treasury empty through fresh expense. But
the true Alexander gives all to his friends, content with the honour of reigning,
setting his true riches in the minds of men. There are wealthy earls, barons there,
and a right long line of knights, who have obtained riches and titles by the bounty
of JameS. Or is it that my studies have an ignoble name, which the King may
condemn and thc scholars ignore? But Paris counts me among men of distinction,
to academie Toulouse my name is known, and Nismes with its crystal fount shews me
respect. Germany, Italy and Spain know me by my books, whetherl shake the
stage with my plays, or wish to write at length in heroic style, or attract the
notice os the best judges in a more learned vein, or write in a free and sportive
tone. The remains os Roman antiquity that had an unequal fight with deeay
rejoice in my protecting name through their restoration to their old splendour.
The reader os Claudian, Aeliam, and the less known Corippus will recognise my
genius But, most mighty l'rince, is this your judgment? No one on these topics
can write more learnedly than yourself. Do you assume the name of our historian.
What, then, keeps back your favour, who has clouded your brow, blighting my
brightest hopes? I recognise the tage of envy‚ and, the envenomed tongue.
The hand Ι (10 1101 see, but 1 secl the blow driven home more stoutly than ever was
the spcarhead of Achilles. While 1 was absent and beset with sever, and a heat
worse than the cave of Aetna glou-ed within mc, eni-y traduced me and sorged false
charges against me that the easy-going monarch might hate me. So the rose grows
up among worms that nip it, and lilies blend with rough brambles. But 1 care not
sor those counsels of the guilty, and it is a sorry thing to be crushed by an evil lot.
My mind is os a loftier east, and the Princo cares not for such objections, becoming
perhaps more placable in years to come, when jackals and the court-fly will be sent
packing. They shall not then wish to fill his ears with evil rumourS‚ and to me
there shall come honour and wcalth‚ and my studies bear a noble name, in a distant
land, if but fate grants mc length of (lays. with a free field for my pen to tell of
famous kings and ages past, and a peaceful old age at the close. Hail, then, august
l'rincc, may your reign be peacesul and happy, fcnccd by the love of your people‚
and may your children's children yet unborn possess your sceptre that is destined to
hand on a wide rule to the British racc !
