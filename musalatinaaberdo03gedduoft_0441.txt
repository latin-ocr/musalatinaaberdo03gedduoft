DAVID WEDDERBURN. 391

Vosque Euri cohibete animos irasque minaces,
Turbida nc valeant effundere nubila vires..
140 Sibilet aura tamen levior quae regis ad aures
Mollius ista ferat. Regis tenet Anglia corpus
Quin animumque, sed usque animi huius Scotia pars sit.
Dixerat, aurigae torto insonuere flagello.
Luminis interea fraenis per aperta solutis
145 Aequora praecipitans aciem iam effugerat axis.

sterling; the maximum reached 800 merks, estImated at ,ζμ 9s. sterling. As ecclesiastica]

much modified aster this concession began to work, there is the inserence that it gave them
some satisfaction ” (Bul-ton, History, vi. 45).

61. In compliment to James, as the mighty humer.
