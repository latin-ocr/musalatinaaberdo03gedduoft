WILLIAM LESLIE.

Dr. William Leslie, one of the ‘¹ Aberdeen Doctors,'' was Μ.Α. of King's College in 1615,
B.D. in 1627, Regent 1t'217-23v sub-Principal 1623-32‚ Principal 1632-39. From his opposition
to the Coveuant he fled the town with Sibbald and others to the king at Berwick, but finding
little encouragement there he returned to Abcrdeen. lived within the college, and saw Dr.
Guild oecupy his place, to whom he resigned the keys. ln July, 1640, the Aberdeen Assembly
deprived him of his place as lazy and drunken. Gordon of Rothiemay labours in his defence:
‘⁴ His lazinesse might be imputed to his :created monasticke way of living, being naturally
melancoliam. and a man of great reading, a painesull student, who delyted in nothing else but
to sitte in his studyc, and spend dayes and nights at his booke . . . if sometymes to resresh
himself, his freends took him from his bookes to converse with them, it ought not to have been
objected to him as ‹lrunkennesse, he being knowne ιο have been sober and abstemiouse above
his accusers. He was a man grave and austere, :ind exemplar. . . . He had studyed a fun
Encyclvpsdia, and it may be questioned whither he excelld most in divinsty, humanity, or the
languages, he being (of course) professor os the Hebrew and Divinitye. . . . For some years
thereafter he lived private in the house of the masque-sse of Huntlye, who was a freend to
learning and learned men ..... Α fter Huntly was engadged in the warre, Dr. Lesly reteered to
his kinnosman, Alexander Douglasse of Spynye, a gentleman who entertained him till his
death [about 16541. He dyed of aeancer. . . . Pittyc it was that he left not more behynde him
of his learned work-es: but the reason was his naturall bashfullnesse, who had so small
opinion of his owne knowledge. that he could scarce ever be gottne drawne for to speacke in
publicke.'’

The testimonics of his friends sound more like raving than sober judgment. Strachan
(Pam-g. Inaug. 1631, p. 38) is excessivo. but is fairly outdone by Sir Thomas Urquhart. He
has to admit that ·· scripturicncy’' (happy coinage. unknown to Sir Thomas Browne l) is a
fault in sceble pens. and that Socrates set forth no books. He believes that this ‘⁴ Cale.
donian Socrates'' had been crus-hed by the merciless ‘¹ Anhes, Lycoris and Melits of the
Covenant ¹* (Tracts, Edinb. 1774, p. 123).

‘⁴ The demands, replys and ‹luplys os the doctors of Aberdeen. as I was informed when
there, though subscribed by six, were all formed and digested by Dr. Seeley (i.c.‚ Leshe), Prin-
cipal of the old town Colledge” (Sage in Maidment's CMalogucs, p. 131). Lines to Leslie
in Lundie's Pocms (Abbotsford Club„ 1845 ed. p. 34), and in Leech’s Epigrammata, iii. p. 63.

He is variously said to have belonged to the house of Kiniuvie. of Crichie. and os Aiken-
way, or Aiknavy in Banff. Bishop Keith (Catalogue of Scottish Bishops, p. 309) asserts that
he was a brother of John Leslie, bishop of Sodor. Raphoe and Clogher (on whom see Musa,
ii. p. 1123 Grub's History, ii. 337; Spalding. i. 372, ii. 156), father os Charles Leshe, writer
of the well-known sliort and Easy Metlmd with tlic Dcists. But this is erroneous; on the
desecuit os Raphon, sce Douglas's Barouagc qs Scolstmd, p. 29, Edinb. 1798.
