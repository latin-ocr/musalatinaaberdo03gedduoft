Mid shady groves and fertile pastures {mdes
The gentle Eclcn with his crystal stream.
11* hither chance some Frenchrnan’s footstcps guidus,
He’d think his native scenes and these the same.
Do we from Franco our wit and valour gain,
Or catch it rising from our nativo plain?

Qua Notus argutis adspirat molliter auris,
Hac placide coeunt 'saus et Oceanus.
Hic facili excipiens venientes littore puppes,
Indigenis vasti distrahit orbis opes.
5 Saepe dolis tentata, et belli exercita damnis,
Invictis animis integra praestat adhuc.
Fama vetus crevit cuin religione renata,
Lucis et hinc fuisit pura nitela aliis.
Alectum dixere prius3 si m xxima spectes
10 Commoda, sors Donum dixeris esse Dei.
Tu, decus aeternum gentisque urbisque, Bo‘e'ti,
Caetera dic patriae dona beata tuae.

DUNDEE.

XVhere the rnild south wind breathes his softer blasts
The river Tay and ocean gently meet,
The wide world’s wealth into her bosom casts
In level shore embay'd the nurn'rous fleet.
The arts of war and all its mischiefs try'd‚
Invincible this ancient town survives,
Increas'd her fame, and to it near ally’d,
Religion, hence pure light to others gives.
Alectum call’d of old, so highly blest,
She claims the title of “the Gift of God.⁷¹
Renowned Boetius, thou canst tell the rest,
Who boast'st this town thy birth-place and abode.
