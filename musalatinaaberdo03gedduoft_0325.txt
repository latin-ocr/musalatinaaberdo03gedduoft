JOHN LEECII. 275

XIX. FOR THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ANJ) LFARNED
SIR JOHN SCOT, DIRECTOR Ob· THE CHANCERY OF
IIIS MOST SERENE BRITISH MAJESTY, JOHN LEECII
SENDS HIS BEST WISHES TO EDINBURGH.

This letter, with the above heading in Latin, is found also in the Leech-Scott correspond-
ence in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. It is dated from Paris, Prid. Kal. Feb¹ 1018.
Leeeh is in a sad and pensive vein, and knows not why. Like Heine. he says 1——

“ Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten
Dass ich so traurig bin.”

It cannot be love; he has renounced the amatory vein. The reference to Neaera is note-
worthy. VVriting from Paris, Leech naturally remembers Buchanan's lines on Amaryllis,
allegorical sor Paris, and his series of epigrams Ad Neaeram. VVarton believed that the same
associations were in the mind of Milton, when he wrote in Lycidas, 07-69 :—

⁶¹ Were it not better done, as others us.;‚
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,
Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair ? '⁹
It is with reference to Neaera that Buchanan wrote the exquisite epigram, perfect in diction
and point, so osten pirated and imitated by others :—
¹⁴ Illa mihi semper praesenti dura Neaera,
Me quotics absum semper abesse dolet;
Non desiderio nostri, non maeret amore,
Sed se non nostro posse dolore frui.''
lt was os these lines that Me'nage said he would have given his best benefice to have written
them.

The letter you read came to you from the city under whose walls steals the
Seine‚ that pecrless stream, with its kindly waters. Ι am with the Scine and the
vales blest with many a vine, and with a grand climate in spring, fleeting the time
with the Muses, yet sad withal. Sad and yet ignorant of the cause. This is
not love, Scot. 1 am in love with no Neaera, though Panthea is sung in my strains.
Love is a God for the gay and for those he sees lying soft and going in fine scented
raiment. Has some old woman at the witching hour of night cast her spells upon
me, making waxen representations of my features, and piercing my heart with her
magic needle? Whatever it is, Ι am most deeply sad. Ι have frightful dreams by
the light of the wandering moon, when beast, bird, and man are all at rest. At one
time I stamp the blood-stained ground with the blood on me of a deeply false
friend ; at another I am hustled into the sluggish waters, as in Rome the youths did
the old men from the gangwayS. Often Ι seem in want to roam strange paths
with an enemy behind‚¹ to pass through charnel houses, and to plant my feet on a

¹ Like one, that on a lonesorne road
Doth walk in sear and dread,
Because he knows a frightsu] flend

Doth close behind him tread.
