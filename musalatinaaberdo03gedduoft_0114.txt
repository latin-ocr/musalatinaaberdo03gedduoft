Patrick’s death is celebrated by many in a brief dirge and in a sew lines; his
life will be a large volume. who shall write it? 1 tear lest another may spoil it,
unless the son consent to write his father's deeds. He was privs· to his character,

Earlier historians have told of the Chatti and eamus. and thc chiess of the
Keiths, great thunderbolts os war. If ages to come bear any historian, let them
celebrate Georgo Keith and his son XVilliam, renowned in peace. Both illustrious:
which was the more so, is· unknown to Apollo himself who has been equally
enriched by both. Young Keith is certainly the more to be wailcd, whom the Fate
has taken off in the prime os life. Ah, how man-x· masterless lands and towers shall
shed tears for their master's luckless sate! Let Inverugie in one compound title
bewail him, one with its ruggetl eraigs, the other with 115 level ground; let the

[Forbes‘ Funcrals, 1635]
(L)

Plus decem Olympiades vixit Cotharisius heros,
Flemus cum propere sed cecidisse nimis:

Nam multum famaeque opibusque sibique suisque
Vixit, sed patriae non satis, 11110 parum.

5 Magna ac multa, inquis, fecit: maiora sed olim

Pluraque facturus, 51 niodo vixit, erat.
