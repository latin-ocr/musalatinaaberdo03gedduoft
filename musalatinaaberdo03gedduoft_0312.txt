V. GULIELMO LESLAEO, PHILOSOPHIAE IN COLLEGIO
REGIO ABERDONENSI PROFESSORI.

Seu primo legerere, sive quarto,
Seu quovis alio meo libello,
Leslaee, id minimi aestimato pili ς
Sin primo positus meo libello

5 Extremus meus esse amicus audis,
Nec primum facis ordinem meorum,
Illud ne minimi aestimato pili:
Sed magni capitis, minusque calvi.
Immo te, nisi fors putas iocari,

10 Toto ponderis aestima esse pluris.

Hic meus Aidius sit meus αἰδίως.
