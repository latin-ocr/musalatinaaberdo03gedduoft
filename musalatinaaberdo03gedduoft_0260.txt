MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

O Fmsmz! the son best beloved ofthe Muses,
The glory alike of thy age and its shame,

Virtue and truth for itself thy mind chooses‚
And kindles its fire at the heavenly flame.

What tears can 1 shed ? And how shall thy praises,
My prop and my boast, be here fittingly sung?

How blend with my sighs the poor flattering phrases,
Or how win relies to my stammering tongue?

From the sad studious throng has the Father been taken,
And when shall another arise at our call?

who mark'd the decay that our empire had shaken,
And bare like an Atlas our state in its sall.

Could each lise follow his and but equal his glory,
The years would run backward and bring in their train

The lost Age os Golcly and revive with its story
The freshness of youth and glad morning again,

Haste. Nymphs of the Don, give the wind to your trcsses,
Bring hither for FRASER the dues to his bicr,

Let the toreh lcnd its glow, while the cyprcss confesses
The triumph os Death, and our tribute—the tear.

Yet here let the ivy and laurel attending
Attest to all ages his worth und his fame;

While flowers, os bright huc, with the red roses blending,
And lilios shall witness our pride in his name.

To the Thames speed amain, bring his bones in your keeping,

Here lay him to rest by our Elphinstone's side:
Toga-ther ‘tis meet that they twain should be sleeping
And one common urn their ashes should hide.
By the help osa King one stablish'd our halls,
The other the triumph pursues all alone ;
()n the tomb that ye saise grave a verse that recalls
The sense of his worth and the grief! must own:
111 this grave lies our Fraser: caclz virtue reviving
His Sires in lise honoured: a name cvcrgrcen:
The lmus! of his Mothcr. His Ie‘sson a striving
Ta keep Natum-’s law ιιηιί ἡ) follow the Mean.

Rector huius universitatis magnifiee) multis nominibus nobis usque

“The chief

magistrate resident in the universsty, answering to our vice-chancellor, and to the Rector
Ellagnzfisus on the continent, had commonly the title of Lord Rector; but being addressed
only as Mt. Rector in an inaugurating speech by the present chancellor. he has fallen from his
former dignvty of style. Lordship was very liberally annexed by our ancestors to any station
or character of dignity; they said the Lord General and Lord Ambassador ¹* (Johnson, Journey
