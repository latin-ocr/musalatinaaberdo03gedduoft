Vis verae effigiem fidei depingere? pinge
Liddelum, uni illi convenit ille color.

Ast alii, Sophiae quibus est bene nota palaestra,
Quid tandem ? numerus, vel sine mente sonuS.
thue alis philomela carens mera vocula dicta est,

Sic artes nostrae hae quid nisi verba hodie?

Throw open the doors of Heaven and wast him to the seats above. Scarcely
does the angel lead the soul of Liddel to the starry mansions, when, lo! the gods
run and ask whence he comes. 'l'hey recognise him, for his same had gone before.
Chiist thus speaks: “The hearts of men are everywhere sunk in a deep slumber,
true love and the power of true saith are rare: but he whom we deern worthy of
honour has followed not the servile mob but Me. Venus and Hymen swayed him
not ; come, Virginity, lead him to our seat‚'’ She hastcns and admits him. Com-
ing near. he marks the stars and wonders at the constellation& gratisying his mathe-
matical and astronomieal love os classification. “Aged Sire,’' begins the goddess,
“do we see and hear you, whom words nor beauty could allure from following in
our steps ?'' She enters at the nurrow door, which Simplicity had opened, but they
are lost in the widenmg vista and dazzling blaze os light. The celestials seed their
eyes on him. Urania, rejoicing beyond her sisters, thus begins: “Our Liddel has
gained his rest; but, since Heaven has many mansions, Liddel’s place is doubtful.
From early days he was my chiesest eare3 for, when Mathematics lay neglected, 1
bore him to the Oder and taught him numbers, figures and astronomical know-
ledge, the source os his great distinction. With what ‹lesign ? 'ro return and saise
the arts by which 1 raised him. Enrol him in our band.'’ But Hygieia spoke:
‘¹ Dcarest sister, 1 do not detract from his merited praise, but how far he towers
above the bands os the merely wise, 1 think has not escaped you, since the days os
his medical distinction. The Oder, the ssaltic, know it. Such distinction claims
another seat, with us. But it is right to refer this to the judgment os Christ.'¹ The
celestials eagerly await the decision. ⁸⁴ vl'hese studies lweigh not: 1 investigate
deeds and Divine Munificence.” Calmly speaks the goddess: “How often and
justly Aberdeen has been widely praised, is known in heaven and on earth. Others
can boast of loftier pileS, greater wealth; but sor sound religion, ancestral hospit—
ality, kindly feeling, Aberdecn holds the first place among her sisters.'’

She is rich also in excellent wits- 133· my advice the noble Keith has established
here a celebrated university. Do you only, renowned son osa mighty sire, be pro-
pitious to us. Suffer not this ornament of your race and house to fall. ‘l'hus shall
you extend to remotest lands your name and same.

These, then, are the first steps, the foundation laid. 'l'hen Johnston brings his
store; aster the bounty of Liddel the university from a humble origin will reach
the huavens, like Aurora rising from the wave. Aberdeen, dowered with this gift,
wails the death os her citizen, the Grampians veil their tops in snow, and Dee
ereeps languidly to the main. But this is no place sor sadness. Liddel is led to
the friendly hands. Not sar from the highest region of heaven there is a happy
