sels. With him to lead, who can hesitate to reach Pindus? The race of Fergus
passes in peace days os jollity‚ and this utterance renews their joy. “ Great king,
may the diadem of your sires belong for ever to you and yours.” 1f you consider
your deathless ancestry, Phoebus sees no diadem like this. Since illustrious ex—
amples win belief, 1 shall briefly touch on a few oi the leading points.

What a storin of Danes raged through all Europe, France and her neighbour
England still remember. The valour of the Scottish kings compelled their retreat.
Why mention the extirpation of the saithless Picts? where, Rome, do you hurry
me along? What flashing brigadeS, what carnage‚ Forth surging with the blood of
kings, Ι seem to see ? Mark the picture of Jamesone—the pedigree of the race
from Fergus, its great founder: let the Scottish Romulus hold the first place. How
mightily stall-:s along Fergus ΙΙ. 1 Kenneth Macalpine turned against the Picts the
engine devised against our name. With his brows eneircled by this diadem Bruce
rose superior to every danger. Mark Mainus, Finnanus, names as ancient as
great ; an age, l'rince, worthy of your reign. Follows Achaius, the founder of the
unbroken league uniting Scot and Frenchman. Note that from early days your
diadem has consecrated pious kings; Donald first opened heaven to man, and then
fell the Druids and superstition. Dongardus prepares the mitre sor holy bishops‚
David grants in addition ample means and demesnes. To your surnarne a passing
reference is enough: remember the Stewarts, a race born to rule. Your sire, the
Sixth, Atlas of his racc. is beyond all praise, his wish being to unite all discords and
be styled the Peacemaker. Others had the wish, you have been the first to unite
those realms in a solemn league, which no time can disannul, while the sea parts us
from all the world.

Mark the divided flock of Christ. Ο wretched party strife, but what have I to
do with this? Go on where the love os peace leads you, rough and beset with many
perils as it may be; the path of peace is trod by the old Fathers, the follower in their
steps cares not for dreams outworn‚ the invention of credulity. Mark how many
dangers by sea and land you have lived through; when France beheld you. when
Tagus led you in your youth to the west. O happy in your lotl the main subsides,
and the winds at command come to fill your sails. Others in the heyday of youth
are enticed headlong to passion ; but you, ever king of yoursels, are considered the
living image of virtue. So your partner, sprung from kings of old, has made you the
father os a lovely offspring, to transmit your sceptro to your descendants. VVars
have involved the world from east to west, but Heaven in its mercy has given peace
to you, and you peace to your people.

Meanwhile the nobles receive with gladsome omens and prayers the king on
his arrival, and the honoured delegates from all parts, bands of illustrious earls and
troops os knights. 'l‘heir servants lay the long tablcs, and pile the board with rich
viands and cups of old wine, heirlooms of their sires. The king's long—expected
presence cheers the citizens. Edinburgh throws open her gates, depicting her love
for you in many a pageant. Let Edinburgh carry off the palm, through her vantage
as capital; believe me, in love of the king she will never conquer her sisters. To
you alone the nymphs of glassy Dee and pearly Don have devoted themselves.
