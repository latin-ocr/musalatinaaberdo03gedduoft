The following extracts are given from a quarto volume of ninety-three leaves in the
Advocates' Library (19. 3. 24). with numerous corrections by the author. The transcript has
been made by Mr. George Stronach‚ sub-librarian there, who describes the volume thus:

¹⁶ The collection consists of parts

x. leones Regum Judac cl Israelis carmine expressae. This portion was printed, with a

dedication to Henry, Prince of Wales (Lugduni Batavorum, 1612).

2. Περὶ στεφάνων, sive De Coronis Martyrum in Scotia.

3. Περὶ στεφάνων, sive Dc Coronis Martyrum in Anglia.

4. Poemata varia, consisting os additional inscriptions, epitaphs, Psalms versified, etc.

In the second part several of the poems have been written subsequently to the main work,
and appear on the verso of the leaves.''

This curicus manuscript had no: escaped the notice of Dr. Thomas M‘Crie, who in the
supplement to his Life of Knox printed the first sixteen extracts (from Hamilton to Hay).
The MS “exhibits traits‚'‘ he says, “in the characters of the principal Scottish Martyrs and
Reformers, with allusions to several events in their lives, which I have not met with else-
where ”. The notes will show how greatly indebted I am lor illustrations of these points to
the unrivalled research and accuracy of that illustrious scholar, whose works form an epoch in
the history of his country, while his erudition is the admiration and the despair of all who
follow him in that field.

patu-iel< Hamilton, martyr at St. Andrews, Feb. 28, 1527.

Germany, where llow the Lahn and the glassy Elbe, first shed the light from
heaven. Happy Scotland. had it followed his leading! But superstition involved
all in Cimmerian darkness It can not endure the light. They burn him. A
shining light in life, he was fitted to give light from the stake.

John Machameus, of Clan Alpine, restorer of Christianity in Denmark..
Professor os Theology at Copenhagen; flourished 1500, according to
Bale.

'l'he Scotland that bore me could not bear me to enjoy the light. No wonder,
itself despised God. ln (ierinanyl met with Luthcr and Melanchthon‚ and saw
Christ in a brightcr day. 'l'hcn Denmark gives me a country and a grave. No
great loss to want a grave at horne ; a greater is to want God there.

Leipsic: on himself and John Maehabaeus.

Our lot in life and exile was the same, ever since we were united in the love of
Christ. Denmark showed you respect, Leipsic heard me. He who reads me can
perecive Machabeus; to know one is to know the other.
