252 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

ning the gamut of the well-worn allusions. On this point of literature Prof. P. Hume Brown
(Buchanan, pp. 134-140) has simply said the last word in his able and lurninous discussion, but
the following quotation from Villari‘s Machiavclli, p. 115, will show with perfect clearness the
historica} origin of the whole difficulty that has not unnaturally been felt by modern readers,
insufficiently acquainted with avery curious literary survival in its relation to the moi-als of the
Italian Renaissance. ‘⁴ Antonio Beccadelli, surnamcd the Panormita, born at Palermo in 1394,
had suddenly acliieved a noisy celebrity by writing a book, that excited great scandat by an
indecency that was not as yet very usual in learned writings. This work, bearing the title
Hermaphroditus, is a collection of epigrazns, that for shameless pungency and indecent ssip-
pancy surpasses anytliing belore written in imitation of the Roman satirists. Not only vice in
general, but obscenity and vieiousness of every description, were the constant subject of his
verses, which, posses-sing some elegance and inastery of many difficult points of style and
language, obtained an extensive success. But very tierce attacks were also made upon the
author. He, however, was in no wise disconcerted by them, and gloried in his book. because
he had written it in imitation ol the ancients, and proved that anything and everything could
be expressed in Latin. He defended himself by quoting Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, Juvenal,
and even Greek and Roman philosopliers and politicians, who, although virtuous men, had
written similar obscenities. lle added that if his poems were open to the same reproach, his
life was without stain. Nevertheless, there was great uproar. Poggio—certainly a man of
few scruples—decidedly blamed him: the Minorite friars hurled their thunders on him from
the pulpit, and according to Valla went the length of burning him in effigy. But Guarino
Veronese, a very celebrated scholar, an old man of sixtv-three, the father of many children, of
the purest character, :ind quite incapable of imitating him, yet defended him energetically,
deriding his detractors, who, <aid he, ‘are ignorant that life has one scope, poetry another.'
And such were, in point of fact, the ideas of the age. Sigismondo, king of the Romans,
crowned Panormita poet laureate in Sienna, and the Hermaphroditus created a school:
for from that time sorward it was considered a merit sor an Italian scholar to write Latin
indecencies.''

The sully cquipped Humanist, in fact, was supposed to have these things at his command
in order to display his mastery over Latin style and vocabulary, in the same way as the modern
pro'essional pinnist includes in liis programme selections from Chopin and Rubinstein. The
question was not one osmonils but purely of r’i‘prrloirc. Yet the time may have passed for
such a thing. ln liis prel‘iitoiy Latin laetter, in the 1620 illusae Priores, to william Herbert,

no Podsnap or mere Young Person, Leech is explicit. though perhaps an undertone of defiance
may be detected. ¹¹5cio, nnc inficias eo, materiem quam plurimis non usquequaque placi-
