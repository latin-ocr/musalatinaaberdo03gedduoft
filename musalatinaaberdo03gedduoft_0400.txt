A full bibliography is given by Dr. Joseph Robertson, in Collections osAbcrdcen and Banff,
pp. 60-65. Extracts are given in chronological order below. His grammatical works merit here
a more detailed account, as they are not only os local importance‚ but they throw light on the
protracted struggle for monopoly in Latin Grammars that lasted so long. ‘* On the subject of
Latin Grammars‚'’ Professor Hume Brown writes, in his sze af Georgc Buchanan, p. 64,
“indeed‚ the battle between the old and the new world was brought to direct issue, and
it was fought with a zeal and determination on both sides that had in it something of the
character of a religious war. The Rudimcnts of ihc Latin Languagc, by Alexander of Villa-
Dei, had been published in 1340, and up till 1514 it had been the text-book in all the mediaeval
universities. It is a curious commentary on human nature that men were still found sar into
the sixtetntli century who seriously maintained that the eternal welsare of youth would be at
stakc is any other book were substituted for Alexander. This Grammar, drawn up by a Fran-
ciscan monk os the thirteentli century, is written in Latin verses, of which each word is meant
to suggest or recall some rule ol Syntax. As originally composed. it was a lamentable enough
presentation of its subject ; but in course of time it had become so overloaded with notes, that,
in Buchanan’s day, it was simply a barbarous puzzle. This subject of Latin Grammars con-
tinued throughout the whole century to be a source of trouble and endless discussion among
the humanists. As the new learning continued to make way in the various countries,numerous
grammars appeared. with the result os introducing considerable confusion into the study os the
language. ln Scotland‚ long alterwards, we shall find, in connection with Buchanan's own
history, that the multitude of Latin Grammars was made a matter os serious discussion in rela—
tion to educational reforrn.'' For Vaus and his relation to Alexander de Villa-Dei, see Aberd.

In 1632 chdcrburne issued his Sltort Introduction fo Grammar, Aberdeem ¹03²· Joseph
Robertson quotes as his authority Ruddiman's Bibliotheca Romana, Edinb. 1757, p. 62. No
copy bas been seen, as it was doubtless thumbed out of existence by the same process of
detrition that renders a copy os the editio princeps of Ruddiman's Gramma-r a bibliographical
dream. The Parliamcnt os 1612 had decided that Alexander Hume's Grammatico Nova should
exclusivcly be used in Scottish schools (For the recommendation, see M‘Crie’s Andrcw
Mctvinc, p. 473, and sor the fierce opposition offered, see pp. 352-3; sor the attacks on Dr.
Alexander Adam os the Edinburgh High School over his own grammar, see Chambers's Biog.
Dicl⁴ i. pp. 14, 15.) Over this parliamentary monopoly granted to one book much trouble
arose. On July 14, 1630, the Town Council granted sorty pounds to VVedderburne, to appear
before the Privy Council “ anent the new grammer set out be Mr, Alexander Hume''.
Weddcrlmrne had asked liberty to use and print his own book. On December 1, 1630, the
Tou-n Council, considering that Wedderburnc·s Grammar could not be printed without sanc-
tion, “thocht meit and expedient that the said Mr. David address himself with the said wark
