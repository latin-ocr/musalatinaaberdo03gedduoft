THOMAS REID.

Thomas Reid, son of James Reid, the first minister of Banchory-Ternan after the Refor-
mation—“a man οἱ notable headpiece for witte, and the most of his children were men of
extraordinary qualifications ”--was born at Banchory. and educated at the Grammar School of
Aberdeen under Thomas Cargill, the Rector, along with David Wedderburn and Thomas
Dempster (Dempster‚ Hist. Eccl. ii. p. 576, ed. Irving). He graduated MA. at Marischal
College about 1600. On Feb. 6, 1602, after a competitive examination in prose and verse for
four days, he was elected co-rector os the Grammar School with Wedderburn. He demitted
that office on Oct. 12, 1603, on being advaneed to a Regency in the College,

Reid subsequently travelled on the Continent, visiting France and Germany. He is
found as a ‘¹ docent ” at Rostock in 1608, and matriculating at Leipzig in 1613. On his return
to his native country he was associated with Patrick Young in translating into Latin the
works of james Vl. ln 1618 he became Latin Secretary to that King. He died in 1624.

The biography by his old school—sellow Dempster is interesting.

“Thomas Reidus Aberdonensis, pueritiae meae et infantilis otii sub Thoma Cargillo
collega, Lovanii literas in schola Lipsii serio didicit, quas magno nomine in Germania
docuit, carus principibus. Londini diu in comitatu humanissimi ac clarissimi viri Fulconis
(irevillii. regii consiliarii interioris et Angliae proquaestoris egit; tum ad amicitiam regis.
eodem Fulcone deducente, evectus inter palatinos admissus a literis Latinis regi fuit.’' This
connection with Grex-illc, whose own epitaph declares he was a ¹¹ servant to Queene Elizabeth,
conceller to King james, frend to Sir Philip Sidney ’' will explain the admiration os Reid sor
Sidney and the Arcadia.

Sir Robert Ayton (Del. Poct. Scot. i. 51-54) has a beautiful Epic-edium in obitum rhomae
Rhoedi. A few lines may be quoted, as the poem is evidently coloured by genuine feeling and
knowledge :—

Nempe tibi infanti, qua Scotia vergit ad Arcton,
Ipsa {uit Pallas nutrix, dedit ubera, cunas
Impulit, adduxit somnos modulamine cantus
Ausonii Graiique; dein cum prima tenellus
Tentamenta pedum faceres, per devia Pindi
Tcsqua, per Aonios lucos et amoena vireta
