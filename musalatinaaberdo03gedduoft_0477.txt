gave so many scions of a racc os heroes? Hermes who bear tlic highest rulo,
distinguished at home and rcspected abroad? But the Fato sparcs them that
deny that laws were made sor them, and estet-m but idle trifles the sear of llell.
Hence the groans os the needy, tyranny crusliing tlic wretched and grass growing
over their ruincd cots. But this was a great hero, the cynosurc of an ancient sace,
chiefglory of the Kcsths, their chief stay, the Muscs' one boast, and the sole hope ol'
the aged tenant; blesscd in tlt-seem, children, wisc. llence his life was illustrious
and brilliant, being to his prince all that Achates ever was to Aeneas, and Parmenio
to Alexander the Great.

[Lat-‘ltrymae Academiae Mam-sclmllnnac. Aberd. Raban. 1635]

Ergone Magnatum turres pede pulsat iniquo
Nec secat aequali stamina Parca manu ἒ
Ergone tot Heroum prognatos stirpe nepotes
Qui dedit, hunc Lachesis sustulit ante diem ?
5 Heroum, quos sumina penes moderamina rerum,
Quosque domi claros extera regna colunt.
Parcit at his qui iura negant sibi nata levesque
Esse putant nugas Tartara quiequid habent.
Hinc inopum gemitus, miseris hinc saeva tyrannis
ιο Instat, et eversas contegit herba casus.
Magnus at hic Heros, gentis cynosura vetustae,
Summa Ketheyorum gloria, summa salus,
Aonidum laus una fuit veterisque coloni
Unica spes; felix stemmate, prole, toro.
15 Inclytus hine vixit, sed et hinc effulsit, Achates
Principis usque fuit Parmenioque sui.
