DAVID LEEC H.

David Leeeh, brother of John Leeeh, was the son os the Rev. Andrew Leeeh, who was
Minister of Maryton‚ or Old Montrose, having been admitted to Lunan before 30th March,
1588. He was a member osthe Court of High Commission, 15th February. 1610. and died at
Moutrose in June, 1611. As his second wife he married, in June, 1608, Magdalen Adamson os
Montrose. There were, as we shall see in the sketch of his son John, brothers and sisters in
the family. and Andrew graduated at King's College, in 1621.

The fact of the father having been a Member of the Court os High Commission should be
noted. It is significant evidence as to his ecclesiastical leanings, especially when taken in con-
nection with the frequent statements by his son John, that he was in some way known to the
King. and the fact is the real clue to the subsequent history of both the sons, John and David.
⁴⁴ It was the year 1610‚“ writes Prof. P. Hume Brown (History of Scotland, ii. 240), *⁸ that saw
James's boldest advance towards the end at which he was so pertinaciously aiming. In Febru-
ary of that year, by a stroke of his pen he imposed upon Scotland two Courts of High Corn-
mission for the punishment of ecclesiastical offences. The history of the similar institution in
England might have shown James the dangerous path he was treading. This very year the
English Parliament keenly protested against the intolerable grievance of such a Court; and its
continued existence, it has been said, was ‘among the most efficient causes of the quarrel
between the monarchy and the nation '. The powers assigned to the Scottish Courts
were as comprehensive and as galling as those of England. Each of thern was to have an
archbishop sor its president and was to consist of clergy and laity—five constituting a quorum.
All the lieges were to be subject to its jurisdiction; offences ⁴⁴ in life or religion '’ were to be
its special province; and fines and imprisonment the means of enforcing its authority. As in
England, it was the arbitrary action, the vaguely defined powers, the undue severity os those
Courts that came to make them a byword for tyrannous oppression with the Scottish people.‘'
This should be remembered in connection with the attitude of David Leeeh to the party of
Bishop Patrick Forbes.

The name of Leeeh, Leythe or Leitch has been thought to be English, and confusion has
thus arisen in the brief notice of the brothers in the Dict. Nat. Βίας, But the Montrose origin
of the family is beyond all question. Jervise (Laud ⁰f the Lindsays, pp. 250—253) explicitly states
it, and as early as 1489 we find a David Leyche mentioned in the accounts of the Lord High
Treasurer of Scotland (Moir's Boecc, Spald. Club, p. 147), while David Leeeh hiinselfis found ad-
dressing lines to ‘⁸ his friend and kinsman Martin Leitch, once of the Royal Wardrobe.'’ His
brother John also has an epigram (Book I. p. 19), ‘t Davidi Leochaeo, a Mounsernille, suo, de
usu rerum.“ David Leeeh graduated at King's College in 1624, became Regent 1627-1632;
Sub-Principal 1632-1638. From the last office he was presented to the parish of Ellon, and
admitted before 3oth June. 1638. His opposition to the Covenant led to his flight from Aber<

deen, to which, however, he returned and gave in his submission, being then restored to his
