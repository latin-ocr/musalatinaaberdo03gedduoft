IANE& ΟΝ ΡᾹΤΚΙΕΚ ADAMSON’S LATIN VERSION OF
THE ‹„x-‘x'1*}‹]C111SM, ΒΥ JAMES LAWSON, MINISTER OF
GOD‘5 WORD.

From the Post. Scot. Musae Sacrae, ἰὶ. p. vi. For Archbishop Adammn, see M‘Crie's

Molvius, p, 461. He there says that the recommendatory lines were prefixed to the edition

of 1581, issued by Lekprevik, the work being first printed at St. Andrews in 1573. Found
also in Adamson's Poe-mata Sama, Lond. 1619.

ΑκῡυΜΕΝτ.

The Sun and Adamson bathe the sea, the earth, and the starry sky in bright
light. Phoebus illuminating the earth with his lighted torch expels the shadows
from the body, bnt Adamson from the mind. So then rcjoice sea and earth, and all
yc souls in heaven. with the highest powers, that a new sun shincs for you, and that
the world has two suns to carry.

IACOBI LAUSONII V.D.M. IN PATRICII ADAMSONI
LATINAM CATECHISMI VERSIONEM CARMEN.

Sol et Adamsonus perfundunt luce coruscfi
Aequora, tellurem, sidereumque polum.

Ignitir Phoebus perlustrans lampade terras
Umbras corporibus pellit, at ille animis.

Ergo mare et tellus, et quas tenet igneus orbis
Caelestes animae, et numina summa poli,

Iam gaudete novum vobis lucescere solem,
Quodque duos soles quos ferat orbis habet.
