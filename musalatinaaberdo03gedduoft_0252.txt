MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Jove had by this sought some far distant shore
Beyond Ind's farthest bound or Eastern steep,
(No joyous revelles at the feast of yore)
The loud-resounding surges of the deep
To fetter in their prison and to keep
The felon wxnds attendant to their chain,
The still-vex'd South Sea into order sweep,
And gather all his scatter'd fleet again,
Lest haply with its spoils it glut the ravening main.

Haply may he, who knows the classic streams

Of Isis and the Cam, deign yet to grace
Don's sluggish current with his gracious beams.

The quick-revolving years sped on their race,
Our hopes and fears now yielding up their place

To cold, dull doubt of Heaven's regarding care ;
With wand’ring steps and slow dejected pace

We sought the winding banks of Don. and there
Pour'd this our weary plaint forth to the listening air.

¹·O Don, east thou on us the pitying eye,
And whelm us in thy tide or far away
Bear as upon thy bosom: hear our cry,
O Father Phoebus, thou bright God of day l
Lct us again behold thy streams, we pray,
Permessus, and Parnassus let us tread;
Do thou our rising fcars and woes allay,
For Elphinstone, Dunbar, and Stewart arc dead,
And Forbes, without peer, low lies thy sacred head.''

At once the horrid thunder seemed to shake
l'he vault ol* Heaven, and Phoebus from his shrine
With graeious speech our trembling souls bespakc:
⁸⁵ Dear Nymphs, how often has this heart of mine
Feli for your wocs and mark'd how you rcpinel
Thc time shall come when Mernory can trace
'sliat course with joy, sor Jove will swist assign
Surcease of all your trials, and his grace
Send forth his richest help to you and to your race.'¹

¹‘ Hither by Jove's decrec l led your band,
And guided iu your wanderings your feet.
Ι set you here. within the Promised Land,
Decreed for ever as your chosen seat.
