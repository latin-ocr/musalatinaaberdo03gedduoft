learned civilian, was elected to teach the Pandects. ln 1619 he was appointed to the Chiur of
Humanity at Bologna. a post held, as he proudly notes, by such men as Paulusv Manutius,
Carolus Sigonius, and Francis Robortcllus (Hallam, Lim. ch. x. ἐξ 19v 35, Ἡ 57).

was at the hottest season of the year (¹ sub aestuante Canicula ’) during the raging osthe dog-star.
The heat and the anxiety proved too much for the over-taxer] Baron os Muiresk. Scized with
a sever, he was carried back to Bologna, where he died, Sept. 6. 1625, in the sorty-sixth year
of his age. He had been knightcd by Pope Urban VIM„ in whom he found a friend, and had

Dempster has long been regarded as the standing example of Sir Henry VVotton's ambas-
sador, “sent abroad to lic sor the good of luis counlry ''. His patriotism is enorinous. and, next
to himself, the idea os scotland and its antiquity seems to have been his besetting weakness.
What has been remembered against him is the detailed knowledge which he shows, in his
Historia Ecclesiasticm os the works os Queen Boadicea or Bundevica (i. ωδ), and King
Fergus (i. ²91)· It may, however, be conceded that his work is of great value when used
with discretion. He was brought during his wanderings into contact with many men like
himself, whose writings he had read, seen, or heard about. the work of rare foreign printing
presses and now irrecoverably lost. His hurried life left him no time sor detailed research,
and he wrote at a distance with no aid from bibliographical specialists.

After all deductions that may be made about uncritical and undigested scholarship, the
erudition of Dempster, exhibited in a short and wandering life, remains enormous. In his
class he is what Marlowe is in the Elizabethan drama, the standard type. The portrait os
this great pupil os the Grammar School of Aberdeen has been drawn by his friend, Matthaeus
Peregrinus, and it should be read entire in the original. It preserves the clear features ot*
the man.

“Dempsterus fuit vir corpore et animo egregius; altitudo illi supra mediocrem vulgaris
hominis magnitudinen13 coma subnigrior, et cuti color non longe dispar; caput magnum, ac
totius corporis habitus plane regius; robur et ferocitas, quibus vel praestantissimum militem
praestare posset, reque ipsa saepius se talem exhibuit. Indefessus in legendo, ita ut quatuor-
decim diei horas librorum lectionem se continuare solitum mihi saepe retulerit. Mentis
acumine satis valuit, sed memoriae tenacitate longe plurimum, adeo ut multoties diceret
ignorare se, quid sit oblivio. Nihil adeo abditum in antiquitatis monumentis cuius non
meminerit. . . . Stylus quidem ei copiosus, confragosus tamen; moribus ferox suit, apertus
omnino, et simulandi nescius . . . consuetudine iucundissimus, amicis obsequentissimus, ita
inimicis maxime infensus. acceptaeque iniuriae tenax, earn aperte agnoscens et repetens.
caeteroquin pius, religiosus, et in iis locis, in quibus mira pietatis Chnstianae visuntur exempla,
non infrequens.'⁷ His language on the Gunpowder Plot is quite up to the Jacobean expecta<
tion, and his detestation of the massacre of St. Bartholomew was too strong sor the editors of
his posthumous History.
