JOHN LEEcn. 255

for a better day, imploring Scot “non exacerbatum canem exasperare aut oleum camino
addere.'' He wishes Scot by hook or crook (⁴⁴ quacunque ratione’') to satissy his creditors.
He was lying low, “obscurus ct nulli notus, secretusque ab omni consortio vivo, occasioni
omni invigilans et admonitionibus amicorum de singulis probe instructus.'' Τιι Mars‘liall he is
especially grateful (⁸¹Jano Martiali suo '' Epig. iv. 74). With wishes for Drummond he ends.
addressing Scot at the close as ¹‘ certissimum meum Musarumque praesidiumff’

We can still trace him. He figures among the list os subscribers to Minsheu's spanisl:
Dictionary as Secretary to the Lord chamberlain, the Earl os Pembroke, and (Stith's History
of Virginita. 1747. p. 193) he is clearly the Mr. Leech who in 1621 was going to view
Virginia and pitch upon a place for a seulement under the care os Pembroke, who had engaged
to plant 3o,oon acres of land and transport 600 personS. In this connection it is curious to
find his sellow townsmztn. Andrew Melville, some years before this date in the tower with Sir
Walter Raieigh and meditating a similar expatriation (M‘Crie's Meluille, p. 290). Ruddiman
(Bibliotheca Romana, p. δι) says Leech published η Rudinzcnm Gramrnaliazc Larinas, Lond.
1624, for the use of James Murray, Viscount Annand, to whom he had been tutor or preceptor.
No copy os this book has been seen, bnt Rud limzin on such a question is excellent authority,
though it seems never to have been used or reprinted in Seotland (Aln'mt'. Qimterscnt. Studics,
p. 324). This james Murray is clelrly the son of John Murray, first Earl of Annandale, who
died in 1640, having been created Viscount Annand on 2³tl1 June, 1622. Leech's pnpil was
baptised in the Chapel Royal at Holyrood on Aug. 19, 1617 (Calderwood's Ηιςίονγ, vii. 277),
succeeding his father as second Earl of Annandale, and dying in 165⁵. His mother was
Elizabeth Shaw, daughter os Sir John Shaw. in the service of Queen Anne. Leech (Epigr.
ed. 1623. p, 61) has lines to her, who, he says, was the ⁴⁸ Aurora¹' os Sir william Alexander os
Menstrie (1604); Palgrave, Golden Treasnry, l. xxix.

A still later date has been noted by Joseph Robertson (Biog. Abrcd. ii. p. 20). ‘⁴ His
(Sir James Balfour's) juvenile attainments in poetry are recorded by our celebrated poet John
Leaeh, or Leochaus in his serenae, published in the year 1626, of which that entitled Janics
is inscribed Generoso Inveni Iacobo Balfourio Kinardio, ‘Hanc tu carminibus‚' etc.. etc.
And likewise from a poem by the same author, on the Panthea of James ssalfour, where he
says—

⁴ Namque ut pulchra satis, minus est mea Panthea casta,
Quum non pulchra minus, et tua casta magis,'

it appears that our author had successfully translated the Panthea of Leach from Latin into
Scottish verse.'‘

Historical Works of Sir James Balfour,’' vol. i. Prefatory Memoir, p. xiv.

The question of Leech is still further complieated by the extraordinary fact that he was
Rector of King's CoHege, jail or no Jail. Robertson (Colle-cliuus Aherd. and Banff, Sfiald. CInb,
p. 66) says Leech more than once held the office. He cites no authority, but his precision is
such that it may be supposed to rest on some ground now lost, and one source of informatiom
certainly not available to Robertsom confirms it. The Commissioners of Visitation elected
Rector on September 14, 1619, “Mr. John Leythe.'‘ and “John Leich‚'' in [610-14, is mis<
printed “Lenta‘' in Fasti Abcrd. p. 452 (see Anderson’s King's Coll. Alitmni (1900), p. ,μ
Rectorial Addrcsses (1902), p. 330). In the last volume it will be seen there are vacant years
till the appointment of James Sandilands in 1623, and it is not improbable that Leech may
have held office in some of them.
