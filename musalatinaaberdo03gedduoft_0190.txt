148 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

CARLrsLE.

Of yore the Roman army's safe retreat,
Bound of their conquests and their chieftains’ toils,

She views the extensive country from her height,
Alarms, defends, and seizes on the spoils.

Her active sons inur’d to martial seat,
And skill'd to hurl the javelin at the soc,

She once the Scottish happy monarch‘s seat,
Now to her former sov’reigns back must go.

In vain the Roman boasts that erst he found
Earth¹s limit here. See other worlds arist:

To mock his distant view. Ambition's bound
ssy Scottish valour sixt unaltcr’d lies.

HADINGTONA.

Planities praetensa iacet prope flumina Tinae,
Fluminis arguti clauditur ista sinu.
Vulcani et Martis quae passa incendia, sati
Ingemit alterno vulnere fracta vices.
5 Nunc tandem sapit icta. Dei praecepta secuta
Praesidio gaudet iarn potiore poli.
3. The dangerous outpost ol* Haddington, often burned and rebuili. See Arthur John-
ston's lines in Musa, ii. 265.

Hmnmorox.

Near Tine's fair stream a spacious plain extends
(Around whose vorge her echoing current bends),
where Mars and Vulcan ravaging by turns

'1¹11' alternate insult still this fair tract mournS.
‘raught by missortune while she Heaven obeys,
High Heaven’s protection her obedience pays.

messuizouxt.

Monte sub acclivi zephyri procurrit in auras,
Hinc arx celsa, illinc Regia clara nitet.

Inter utramque patet sublimibus ardua tectis
Urbs arn-iis, animis clara, frequensque viris.

5 Nobile Scotorum caput, et pars maxima regni,

Paene etiam gentis integra regna suae.

Rarac artes et opes; quod mens optaverit, aut hic
Invenias, aut non Scotia tota dabit.
