ROBERT GORDON, 01⁴· STRALOCH. 91

and he only finished a very few of the county descriptions. Soon aster. Srraloch was much
abused (in the edition of 1655) by the publisher. who dedicated the book to Oliver Cromwcll,
instead os King Charles 11.. omitted some of his best descriptions (particularly those os
Aberdeenshire and Banss) andi presaced the whole with Buchanzm's Dialogue Dc Jurc Regni.
Before the maps, are 19 discourses relating to the general state os the Kingdom ‘' (Man, pp.
7» 8» 9)·

11. Miscellaneous lissays on Antiquiiies.

¹¹ Some os Straloch's lesser Compositions in Latin touching the Antiquities ol his native
country, were deposited by his sorementioned worihy son, Mr. Jnrnes Gordon, Minister os
Rothiemay. in the hands ofSir Robert Sihbald. who cornmunicated to Bishop Nicholson his
Notes on Betle's History '¹ (Man, p. 9).

ΙΙΙ. Notcs on Hector Boece.

¹¹ I have seen his short Notes on Boyes' llistory‚ writ with his own hand on the margin
of that copy of Boyes which belonged to him ” (Man, p. 9).

IV. Letter to David Buchanan.

‘¹ There was a critical letter os his to David ssuchanan, dated July 25· 1649, on the subject
of the Scotish Historiam, in the possession os Sir Alexander Seton of Pitmedden, from which
Dr. Nicholson published some extracts'' (Man, p. 9).

V. History of the Gordons.

‘⁴ His History of the illustrious Family of the Gordons, which is carried down only to the
year 1595, is writ in a clear and concise Latin style and very exact as to the Gcography oi
Places, with which he was so well acquainted. 1 have seen the original MS. os this Book,
which has been composed after 1655, as appears by his mentior-ring spotswood’s and Johnston's
[Robert Johnston] Histories, which were not published till that year, with the Remarks os Mr.
Robert Burnet os Crimond and Dr. George Middleton, Principal of the King's College of
Aberdeem upon it. Ι have likewise seen several copies os it, two very correct and one very
sair with the Author‘s Effigies written and drawn, I suppose, by Robert Gordon, his grandson
by his son Arthur, and founder of the Hospital at Aberdeen. Straloch's high notioris ol* the
royal power, join'd to his affection for the family of Huntly, led him to say some severe things
of our first resormers [this should be noted in connection with his lines on Forbes]‚ and their
immediate Successors, whose example, he says in his preface to Spotswood's History, the
Covenanters copied after ¹' (Man, p. 11).

Robertson adds, ⁴¹ Here Man makes some animadversions on points in Straloch’s Book
about the Regent Murray, which information ‘Straloch says he had from his saffier'ss‘ As
that father was a confidant of George, sixth Earl of Huntly, the man involved in the affair os
the Spanish Blanks, it is clear that family relationship biassed again his political opinions.
Gordons and Forbeses have largely corrupted local history, and are suspect,

VI. His Preface to Spottiswoode.

‘⁸ Straloch in his preface to Spotswood's History (which Ι have seen written in the Author’s
own hand, with some short notes of that History), speaks with great passion os Buchanan
and Knox'' (Man, p. 25).

VII. Translation os Knox's dispute with VVinrame.

¹* Knox’s dispute with Dean John Winrame, Sub-prior of St. Andrews and Arbngkill, a
Franciscan Friar, concerning the Romish Ceremonies. has pleased Straloch so well that he has
taken pains to translate it into Latin: of which Translation (the original may be seen in Knox’s
History) 1 have a copy in my possession ⁷¹ (Man, p. 25). ⁵¹ His son Jarnes, besides the assis-t<
ance he gave his father in describing the County Maps os Scotland drew a map of new and
