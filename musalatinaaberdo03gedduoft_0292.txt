lV. ΟΝ THE DEATH OF THE MOST LEARNED AND ERU-
DlTE BISHOP WILLIAM FORBES, l).t)., FIRS'I' BISHOP
OF EDINBURGH.

“The following elegiae lines on Bishop Forbes, by an unknown writer, were found
among the late Professor Christie's MS. memoranda, entitled‚ ⁸ MS. on a Copy os Cousidcra-
tioncs Mutia-‚lac cl Pacificae,' '¹ etc. (Londini, 1658), Lippe's Wudmw, p. lxxvi. That the lines
are by Leech is inserted with probability, Mosa, ii. 26. For the connection of Forbes with
Marischal College as Regent and Principal, see Fasti Αιαιι. Mar.. ii. 28, 31. Plura, by Sir
William (jeddes in Musa, ii. 26; Principal Lang in Abcrd. Qwih r. Sliuiics, 41-42. A
full biography in Lippe's [derutig Introd. lxxii-vii. pp. 247-69, where his pertrait by Jame-
sone is reproduced. Bayie, Dict. s.v.. notes him as a strenuous advocate os the Aristotelian
philosophy. Burnet said he had ¹¹ a strange faculty of prcaching live or srx hours at a time ’'.
For his general tediousness condemned by his brethren. see the account iu MUrie's Mchillc,
p. 38⁸- Andrew Strachan in his Pauzgvricus Inungui-alis, 1631, p. ιι), exhausts the language
of hyperbole on this apparently weak man. “ Ad cuius nomen obstupesco. Scientiarum is est
Oceanus, eruditionis abyssus. ln Bibliotheca. quam habet, instructissima nullam se doctiorem
schedam agnoscit: et tamen non mavult quicquam scribere quam scire. Nescio an Theologum
maiorem oculus hic mundi norit. Meliorem certe virum haec aetas non tulit.'‘ These lines

os Leech represent the latest date yet traeed in his own lise, a year later than the issue os his
Pari-rga in 1657.

ARGUMENT.

Bishop Forbes had his seat lately in this church‚ now he lies buried in it. O
sad and sudden change! He sat neither lustra nor years, scarcely a hundred days
in all. His risc to the sec, like his death, was unhoped for. His sull and real worth
was known to none, scarcely even sufficiently to himself. The most learned man os
his country and age, his knowledge was universal. llis was the gift of fiery tongues
in many a form os speech as at Pentecost. His lise was apart, somewhat severe.
Evil men could not beai· him, nor he them. Offended at the faults os his age, he
rises secrctly to mansions above. and left a world unworthy osso great a light.

Nuper in hae l'raesul Forbesius aede sedebat,
Nunc sed in hac ipsa mortuus aede iacet!
Heu tristes subitaeque vices, non lustra nec annos,
Vix totos centum sederat ille dies!
5 thue insperato Cathedram conscendit honore,
Sic insperato funere desiluit.
