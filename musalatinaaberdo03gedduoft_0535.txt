who were in the Naval and Military Services, to bv
called “The Gordons under Arms,'' has been really
delayed by the fact that, while the work has been in
progress, an enormous amount of military documents
hitherto quite unavailable to the searcher, has been de—
posited at the Record Office, and Mrs. Skelton has had
to go over them caresully. She has also, with the aid of
Dr. Littlej0hn‚ made an examination os the Gordon
entries in the Commissary Records of Aberdeen. She is
now engaged in co-ordinating her material, and the result
will be a volume absolutely unique in the annals of mili-
tary history. The Duke of Richmond and Gordon, a
Vice-President of the Club, takes so much interest in the
progress of the work, that he has lent ΜΓ. Bulloch some
two thousand letters bearing on the raising os the four
different regiments by his ancestor the fourth Duke os
Gordon. These documents have never previously been
examined by historians and they afford some amazingly
good material.

Meantime, the results ofagreat amount ofinvestigation
have been put in print in apreliminary form. In addition
to a volume of what may be called readable Gordonology
called “The Gay Gordons,'' Mr. Bulloch has issued
sundry pamphlets, and sor the first time a family has
come sorwarcl to print at its own expense the investi-
gations among its ancestors—the Gordons of Min-
more and Auchorachan. The Banffshire Field Club
has printed some articles and the Buchan Field Club
has one in hand. Articles on Gordons have also ap-
peared in the A berdeen [ἤτε Press, Α berdeen Journal,
A berdeen Weekly sournal, Huntly Express, Fraser-
burglz Herald, Pelerlzead Sentinel, Bmfflzire Journal,
