278 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

vernacular tide had turned, he knew it not. By renouncing his native tongue sor Latin,
Buchanan all over Europe had secured a reputation‚ and won its ear for his History. He
was with Europe, as Henri Estienne said, poctarum nostri saeculi facile princeps. Johnson
even spoke of him as enjoying a distinction ‘⁶ perhaps fairer than the instability of vernacular
languages admits ''. John Hill Burton (Scot Abroad, i. pp. 182, 183) notes that in Scotland as
in Holland, the Latin tradition was maintained long after England, France, Italy, Spain were
laying broad the foundations osa native literature.

In Scotland there was reason for this. Between Alexander Montgomery‚ the last os the
'⁸ makars.‘’ and the revived native tradition with Allan Ramsay, the poetica} hemisphere of
Scotland is almost total darkness. Drummond is scarcely remcmbered except by research.
Sir Robert Ayton certainly staked his reputation on his Latin lines in the Dclitiae and not on
his English verse. though it is the latter that has kept his name alive with posterity. Nor was
the feeling confined to Scotland. Bacon doubted the lasting power of English, and deliber-
ately wrote his Novum Organum and much os his work in Latin. Waller thought that

*² l’oets that lasting marble seek
Must carve in Latin or in Greek,u

which is the more noteworthy as coming from the man that was ¹⁴ smooth '' and that ‘¹ tuned
our diction and refined our numbers ” in the famous phrase of Dr. Johnson. But there is more
powersul support for Leech in the greatest quarter. Milton in his 1641 Churcle Governmcnt
has made an explicit statement on this very subject. ⁸³ 1 applied mysels to that resolution‚'' he
says, ⁴* which Ariosto followed . . . to fix all the industry and all the art Ι could unite to the
adorning os my native Inngnc . . . to be an interpreter and relater os the best and sagest
things among mine own citizens throughout this island in the mother dialect. That what the
greatest and choicest wits os Athens, Rome. or modern Italy, and those Hebrews os old did for
their country, Ι, in my proportioni, might do sor mine.'' So he wrote in 1641, but we know that
up to 1639 in his long search sor a subject he had thought of a Latin epic. See his lines to
Mauso. the friend οἱ 'l'asso and Marini (7-9), sor his declaration on the Arthur Legend and the
Round Tablc (So-255), written in 1635. In 1639 he had returned to England, and it is only in
that year, as should bc noted, that he bids adieu to the idea os a Latin epic and definitely
pledgcs himselsto an English medium. Epitaphium Damonis, 170.

Brittonicum strides.'¹

But he knows the consequence of adopting ⁴⁸ our harsh northern wliistling, grunting guttural ”
(Bcppo, xliv.). Hc will be unknown abroad, and confined to a purely English audience,

‘¹ Sim ignotus in aevum
Tum licet. externo penitusque inglorius orbi ”.

lt is not improbable that Milton's residence abroad had increased his patriotism, seeing the
feebleness that had reduced the Delia Crusca and Svogliati clubs to inanities os ⁴⁶ flattery and
fustianf· and encouraging him “to leave something so written to astertimes, as they should
not willingly let it die ’'. Like Leech, Milton admired Ovid, and accordingly he, too. admired
'sasso when he contemplated an epic. he had in view ‘· those other two {poems] of Virgil
and Tasso as a model ''. Arthur Johnston's Psalms may be considered in this light, not only
as a rival, by Laud's advice, to Buchanan. but as an attempt to provide a poetical niche sor
himself in the literature os his country.
