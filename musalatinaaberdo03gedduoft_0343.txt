The hero os Corsc has shusssctl oss this mortal coil, the chief glory os thc (iram-
pian sires. For nearly cighteen years Aberdecn was proud os him as bishop‚ :in
objectos envy to her sistet-s. lle eclipscd his ancient (iod-like predecessors, yet
assigned them their duc meod ot* praise. Hc alone propped the falling house which
they set up. Ilc alone restored ruined atl‘airs to soundnCSS, and remodclled all,
greatly improved. Thai learning is not in bcggary, the Church (lespoilcd, is in
either case duc to Forbcs.

ELOGIUM FUNEBRE PATRICII FORBESII.
[Forbes' Funerals‚ 1635.]
1.

Maximus exuvias posuit Cotharisius heros,
Inter Grampiacos gloria prima patres.
Hoc prope ter senos Devana superbiit annos
Praesule, cognatis invidiosa deis.
5 Obruit hic veterum Semonum lumina, lucem
His tamen et laudes reddidit usque suas.
Unus hic inclinata stitit, labentia fulsit,
Quae decessores constituere sui.
Restituit disiecta unus, defecta refinxit
10 Omnia, sed meritis macta subinde novis.
Quod Schola non squallet, quod non Ecclesia vasta est,
Utraque Forbesio debet utrumque suo.

ΙΙ.

Die Pater Cotharisi‚ ingens patriaeque patrumque
Praesidium, quo respublica stante stetit ;
