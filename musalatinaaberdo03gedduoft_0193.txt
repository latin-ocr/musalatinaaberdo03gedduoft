S‘ranNUM.

¹¹ The bulwark of the North,
Grey stirling with her towers and town.''
—Scom Lady of the Lake, v. ni.

Regia sublimis celsa despectat ab arce
Pendula sub biferis moenia structa iugis.
Regum augusta parens, regum nutricula natis,
Hinc sibi regifico nomine tota placet.
5 Hospita sed cuivis quovis sub nornine, amicus
Sive eS, seu non εδ, hospes an hostis item.
Pro lucro cedit damnum. Discordia tristis
Heu quoties procerum sanguine tinxit humum !
Hoc uno infelix, at felix caetera, nusquam
10 Laetior aut coeli frons, geniusve soli.

ιο. soli. “The links os Forth, worth an earldorn in the Nortli.''

STIRLlNG.

Parent of monarchs, nurse of kingly racc,
The lol‘ty palace from its height looks down
On pendant walls that guard the lower town,
While royal title gives it noble grace ;
Friendly to all whatever be their name,
Inmate or foe, or real l‘riend or seign'd.
Danger to profit yields. How oft, oh shamel
Has noble blood her territory stain'd l
Hapless in this alone, to none she yields

The bliss oflgenial air or fertile fields.

URBES FrFAE LITTORALES.

The coast towns of Fife, the stronghold of the Church party, as the Devon seaports
were of the Elizabethan Purstans, formed the most developed part of Scotland at the time.
James VL regarded them as a ⁴ fringe os gold on a eloth os frieze '. ‘⁴ There's the kingdom os
Fife,‘⁷ says Andrew Fairservice, in Rob Roy, ch. 14, ‘⁴ from Culross to the East Neuk, it'sjust
like a great combined city—sae mony royal burghs yoked on end to end, like ropes os inganS,
with their hie meets, and their booths. . . . Rirkcaldy, the sell o¹t‚ is langer than ony town
in England.” For the Spanish trade of Anstruther at the time of the Armada, see M‘Crie's
Metalla, p. 137. Largo preserves the memory of Selkirk and Juan FernandeZ. and of Sir
Andrew Wood (scon, Tales osa Grandfatltcr, ch. 23). Sir Patrick Spens still walks ‘on the

strand' near Dunfermline, in the ballad. For the contrast of the Fife skippers with ⁴ the Fise
lairds ¹ see Scott, ibid. ch. 66.
