Diwl D WEDDERBURN.

David Wedderburn, or Weddeffiurne, was born in Aberdeen in 1580, the son of Williani
Wedderburne and Marjorie Annand, the other meinbers os the sannily consisting Ἰοί two sons,
William :ind Alexander, and three daughters. lle was educated at the (iraminar- school under
Thomas Cargill, and was remembered long aster by Thomas Dempster as a school-fellow·
Whether he studied at King‘s College or Marischal Collega is uncertain, though the probability
is in favour os the latter (Fasti Acad. Mar. ii. 185). ()n Feb. 6, 1602, after due trial and exami-
nation of Wedderburne and Thomas Reid (qm.) by public teaching before the Provost, baillies
and others; and a competitive examination in prose and verse sor four days, both candidates
were elected conjunct tectors of the Grammar School. On April 20, 1603. he beggtd to
resign as intending to enter the ministry, to which he· had been pressed by a provincial
assembly; but on Sept. 7, 1603, he craved to be reponed and was readmitted. Reid, on
being elected a Regent in Marischal College, resigned on Oct. 12, 1603, and W‘eddssrbffl'ne
was elected sole master, not to quit office without leave and six months‘ notice, for which he
had to find caution in the sum os 300 merks. his uncle David Anderson becoming cautioner.
Complaints were made on Oct. 24, 1604, against extortionate sees, Candlenms dues⁹ etc„ by
which ‘¹ abuses and novations diweris of the gentillmenis bairnis to landwart ar drawin hame
and tal-:in furth of the gramer schooll,‘' and boarding money lost to the town, In 1612
occurred a great barring out. The scholars took possession os the Song School and held it
with guns, hagbuts and pistolS. They attacked the citizens, ¹⁵ and maistersullie away took
their foullis, pultrie, breid and vivaris.'' The insurrection lasted for two days, when the
magistrates suppressed it hythe expulsion of the ringleaders. But no blame sor this outburst
seems to have attached to Wedderburne.

On July 26. 1615, he received a gratuity from the Town Council lor conducting the high
class at Marischal College till it graduated, ori the death of the late Principal Gilbert Gray.
In 1619 (K. C. Off. and Grad. p, 46) the was elected Humanist at King's College, appointed
under Bishop Forbes’ Commission of Visitation, though he did not receive any salary. But
on Feb. 10, 1620, he received on application an increase of his own stipend, the Council giving
him “by and attour'¹ the sum of So merks yearly, by which he became bound to teach
Humanity once every week within the College (Marischal College], and compose Latin
themes in prose and verse, either at horne or afield as he should be required by the Magis-
trates. On February 16, 1620, Friday morning, immediately aster the morning prayer, was
fixed for the time of the Humanity lecture to begin on Friday, Feb. 253 but this ceased on
*Oen 20, 1624, as interfering with his school duties. On Sept. 22, 1629, his salary was raised
by 20 merks quarterly. On July 8, 1640, he demitted office, signing as '⁴ M. D. Wedderburne
Sexagenarius et ultra,’' ‘⁴ having continewit sourtie yeires in the said service ”. He had been
elected in 1602, and unless the term is used roundly he rnay have acted before as a ⁴· doctor ’“
or undermaster in the School.
