JonN KER.

Can keep the tear from falling? But our weal,
Sore then bcset from hands that strove to rend

'l'he lead from off our roos, found one with smel,
Steel to opposc and Anderson a friend,

And rcseucd archives still our charters can defend.

Yet not in this could our woes find an end.
Our guiltlcss band to banish was their aim3
Themis and Medieine into exile wend,
civi! and canon law but find the same
Fate as Hippocrates and Galen‘s name.
Nor e'en can Orpheus, that with tune-ful lute
Could Pluto move, find one to own his fame,
Hush'd is Arion’s lay, the Muses mute,
And Alma Mater lay bound hclpless hand and foot.

Then Hunger, Want, with all their diresui host
Beset our door3 yet still by Heaven's command
In Jove's vice-gerent, JameS, when all seemcd lost
The Muses found the friend, the open hand
Our stote increasing and with gifts of land
Drawn from his bounty, and let here the bays,
Maitland, entwine thy name that blessed our band:
Nor let the minstrel here forget to raise

Arbuthnot to thy name, and Stcwart, the song of praise.

Nor yet could wc enjoy these fruits, for dire
Foul Harpies rest them from us and would tear
Them in their crooked talons, til] our sire
Famed Patriek Forbes, he of Corse the heir,
Arose from his ancestral home to bear
Aid in our sore distress3 for he alone
Restored the shatter'd state by timely care,
Raised us when low and needy, all hope gone,

Heard in our deep distress and mark’d our weary groan.

Our aged mother to his breast he takes,
And warms her there. and bids new shoois asise
In fresh and lusty youth, and then he makes
The Harpies to disgorge their stolen prize
Of rents and revenue83 back Themis flies,
The grand old man of Cos returns again,
Orpheus awakes the strings. Arion tries
The warbling voice and wakes the vocal strain,
While Muses roam the fields with garlands in his train.
