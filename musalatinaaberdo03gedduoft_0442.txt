95. Andraeae. Arthur Johnston in his lines on St. Andrews, vol. ii. p. 268, wisely avoids
this quantity.

Accord, pp. 13-15.

104. ⁴⁴ Before James returned to lingland he granted a renovation of the ancient charters

of the borough, by which he confirmed, in the most ample manner, all the former rights, pri-
vileges and immunities of the citizens. The charter of confirmation is dated at Faulkland,
17th July'' (Kennedy, Annals, i. p. 1 17¹, Munro. Aldermcn and Provosts, p. 125).

110. Lemma, λῆμμα, theme, title. The Delitiac text gives limina, but Irving, Scotish
Pom, i. 204, affords the means of emendation.

116. The festal eries of ‘¹ Bon-Accord '' are strangely referred by both Irving and Kennedy
(Annals, i. 91, 92), not to the inebriating effects os the Cup of Bon-Accord, but to the survival
os the shouts‚ greeting the old Abbot and Prior os Bon-Aecum, in connection with the Mystery
plays.

118. solomon. Henry 1V. of Francc said James was necessarily Solomon, as “the Son

James was ⁸* the wisest sool in Christendom.’'

V. DAvn) WEDDERBURN REPLIES To DR. ARTHUR
JOHNSTON.

'she letter of Johnston which calls forth this reply should be carefully studied in Musa,
vol i. pp* κρυ-94. It is perhaps the most sinished and interesting persormance of that master
of elegiae verse, and naturally it rouses wedderburn ro a reply in the same metre. ln the
1632 Parcrga os Arthur Johnston the lines here given follow, reprinted in the Delitiae. The
letter and the reply are both of great local interest, as they contain many biographical touches
in the lives os the writers. Johnbton carries oss the palm sor ease, simplicity and finish of
style ; Wedderburn seems conscious os that, and hals humorously ascribes this to the woes os
his profession. He seels (25-26) he is getting old and that his ‘¹ nature is subdued to what it
worked in. like the dyer's hand '' (Shala, Soum’t cxi.). interesting, too. is the glimpse oi the
Rector in his den, ‘¹ the den of Palaemon,” in the old Schoolhill building (15). weary of gerund
grinding and a stranger to the poetical dreams os his youth. Notable, also, is the picture os
the sarcwell os the two friends at the pier (in 1599, Musa, vol. ii. p. xvih). with its glimpses
of the old 1inks, as seen in the 1661 Gordon map, and οἱ the old course of the Don (Kennedy's
