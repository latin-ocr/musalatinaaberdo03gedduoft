His being working in mine own,

A life that all the Muses deck'd
With gists os grace, that might express
All-comprehensive tenderness,

1 sec your white hans, Jnlmston, and fast fall my tears. XVhere is our golden
prime? But the cause ess-*apes me not, for all the wocs os Sisyphus, Tityos, Ixionv
the Danaides, are nothing to the wocs 1 bear in the den os Palaemon. The same
blemish tells on the worker and his work. In teaehing the young idea how to shoot,
1 have missed my old poeticalaspirations3 but why shift Camarina? Ι ever thought
the Muses somewhat idle, but your fortune has been equal to your genius·⁵ as you
press on to Pindus, the hand of Ovid has culled you a garland. You have sisted all
the wisdom of science, of medicine, and of philosophy, sounding with rare skill the
depths of nature. ‘

1 forcsaw this when in your tiny skiff you skirted the shores of poesy: you call
me on, I follow more slowly. Common tastes united us· in a common love, which
fears no difference of lot, gathering strength with forty years. No wintry blast, 1
challenge heaven, conquers ourlove; let not the great names of mythologie-al friend-
ship take the prize from us. Hence my grief, while you were in foreign parts.
There is a spot at the sandy beach; how often did Ι groan and wecp here, when the
zephyrs filled your sails! Where yet 1 could follow them, I was Phyllis and Lao-
damia. As often as 1 stalked on the deserted beach, you ever were the cause of my
sadness. How often I cursecl Tiphys, and the first farer in the deep! How often
did I cry, What is all the wealth of the Arabians without you, my chiefest joy? But
Heaven has wisely considered my grief, in guiding your triumphant return. Let me
to you be like Medea, renewing your comforts in life as she did the old age ofAeson‚
and let Bacchus and Venus attend me. Let the one banish care, and let the other
grant that your Cynthia ever love you as when young. If meantime 1 sing aught,

lead off: you were, and ever shall be, ‘¹ my guide, philosopher and friend ''.
