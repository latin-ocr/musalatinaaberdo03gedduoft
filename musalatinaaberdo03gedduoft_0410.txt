ΙΙ. THE APOTHEOSIS OF DUNCAN LIDDEL.

A specimen os w'edderburns powers as the Poet Laureate of Aberdeen. At a somewhat
later date we find him. Feb. ιο, 1620, agreeing to teach a weekly lesson in Marischal College
sor the yearly su¹n os eighty merks, *⁸ And thairwith to compose in Latine both in prose and
verse quliatsumewir purpose or theme concerning the commoun affairs os the Toune ather at
haine or :iheld as he salbe requyred be :iny of the magistratus or clerk in tyme comeing''
(Fasti Arad. Mar. i. p. 183). He takes here the opportunity os inserting a eulogy of the town,
the Grainmar school and Marisciul College. He even audaciously glorifies the climate and
the weather of the wintry Granite City. The Bull os Pope Alexander Vl. for founding King's
College diplomatically referred to the ‘⁴ healthy climate ’¹ of Old Aberdeen; but Wedderburn
is more decided. james Gordon, 1660 (Book os Bon-Accam. p. 20) says ‘⁴ the air is temperat
and heultlisul about it: And it may be that the citizens ow: the acuteness of their wits thair-
unto and their civili inclinations''. Robert Gordon (Calli-ctiam os Abcrdccn and Banſj‘, p. 3)
praises the ·· caelum temperatum ct salubre,'' the admiration os Danes, Prussians and Potes!

'l'he naive feeling in the Apotheosis by the rector os the Grammar School almost inevitably
recalls the remarks os a later scholar os the school, Lord Byron. in his own Vision of Judg-
ment : ‘¹ lt is possible that some readers may object to the freedom with which saints, angels
and spiritual persons discourse in this l‹⁷ision.'' Wedderburn's lines are found in the 1614
oration by Gilbert Gray, second Principal οἱ Mar-ischa} College. Oratio Funcbris Iu Mc-
moriam CI. Viri Duncani Liddclii Medicina Dat-toris ct Maure-matum Prostssoris Celeberrimt'.

(imminu Sehool. and possibly at King‘s College„ he left Aberdeen in 1579 when eighteen‚ and
travelled through l’oland to Franksort on the Oder, where John Craig, afterwards first physician
to james- V1., taught logie and mathematics Liddel resided there for three years, studying
