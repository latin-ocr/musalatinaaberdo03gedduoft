strength he falls before h1s day. He was master of sels and his people; renowned
sor all the native virtues of his father he burst in light upon the world, as Phoebus
from the East seeks high heaven. Had he reached his full meridiam splendour, that
prudence of his growing with the unmarked growth of time would have illuminated
the whole world. But the Father of All would have him shine a sun in heaven. As
at early dawn the marigold opes its yellow flower and greets returning day, later at
even it folds itself and droops its head, so ye Muses with veiled sace pour your
team. No ages have given, no distant future shall give a youth of greater promise.
Alas, helpless youth! had sate so allowed, you were Henry the Great. Bring lilies

Ergone spes regni cecidit? pavor ergo reliquit
Et tremor hostiles animos ? Choreaeque, chorique,
Quasque voluptates dant connubialia festa,
Quasque, Hymenaee, tuis spondent genialia saeris

lte. Dolor subeat, gemitus, et tristia quicquid
Pectora vel condunt alte vel carmine promunt
Lugubri, tacitae per muta silentia noctis.
Tuque adeo threni semper lachrymabilis auctor
10 Melpomene, laniata genas, laniata capillos
Huc ades, 01 tanto talique heu principe dignos
Fundito ferali cum carmine fundito fletus.
