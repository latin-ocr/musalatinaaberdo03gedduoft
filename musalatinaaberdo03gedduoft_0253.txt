JOIIN KER.

The King of Hcaven (doubt not) himself will meet
Ere long your eagcr eyes and comfort send.

ilungcr and NVant and Harpies foul shall fluet
Far oss, sor nigh 15 your appointed friend.''

Hc ceased, and gurgling Don bare burdcn in the end.

At words like these the heart Within us burncd,
Swift from the river's brink oui· homeward way
We took but, erc our sootsteps we had turned,
Hope broke upon us with a cheering ray.
'l'hen came the Fraser letter to allay
Our anxious fears and bid our walls arise,
Our ehambers to fot-get their old decay
And now in Parian marble meet the eyes ,·
Agaim and yet again, fresh lavish gifts surprise.

Roll swist and high the song os praise‚ the tale

of Fraser's bounty in our darkest hour,
When Muses fled from Aganippe’s vale

And left untenanted their ancient bower
Ofsong; when Clio, too, consess'd the power

Of fate and in the hails of auction pined,
XVhen servile tasks upon us seemed to lour,

When Jove himself to us had proved unkind‚
'swas then we found one son in Fraser's filial mind.

On wondrous columns now our crumbling haus,
Home of the Muses, rest by his command:
In gleaming marble blocks arise our walls,
The store of books attests 1115 bounteous hand.
No more let Elphinstone, Dunbar, demand
Chief meed of honour, but let Fraser’s name
Graven in deep heraldic blazon stand,
Apelles lin-in him and, to grace his same,
Let the Quadrangle now his statue high acclaim.

The Nymphs attendant cull for thee the rose,
The myrtle and the ivy‚ violets sweet‚

Twine garlands out of every flower that blows
To decl< thy head withal in honour meet.

But, Fraser, how shall we thy worth repeat.
The Muses’ darling? task beyond our care.

Our vows sor thee we raise to Heaven’s high seat:
‘Thine be the years of Nestor⁷ 15 our prayer,

‘ And rich in all that blest and good is be thy share.’
