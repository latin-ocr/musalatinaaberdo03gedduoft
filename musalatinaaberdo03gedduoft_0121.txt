ARGUMENT.

Because such a divine ardour has taken hold of your mind, John (Ian), of
following in the footsteps of your uncle, distinguished for his medical skill‚ the
loved band of the Muses and Phoebus Apollo hasten to twine lairest garlands sor
your head. I thank them in my heart and pray that to all you may recall the decds
of your uncle, who is worthy to pass the years of Nestor, that so he may snap the
threads of cruel Lachesis.
