158 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

In English thus :-

From her high Rock great Nature's VVorks suweys,
And kindly spreads her Goods thro⁷ Lands and Seas.
why seek you Fire in some exalted Sphere?

Earth’s fruitful Bosom will supply you here.

Not such whose horrid Flashes sear the Plain,

But gives enliv'ning Warmth to Earth and Men.
Iron, Brass and Gold its melting Force obey;

(Ah ἔ who's e'er free stom Gold's almighty Sway ?)
Nay, into Gold 'twill change a baser Ore,

Hence the vain Chymist deifies its Pow’r;

lf't be a God, as is believ'd by you,

This Place and Scotland more than Heav’n can show,¹

ΟΝ “THE SPHERE’¹ OF GEORGE BUCHANAN.

Moumexr.

When Phoebus saw such a monument of labour so unregarded in silence, he
groans and sayS, “ ᾺῚιειῖ limit or what remcdy shall there be sor such a great mis-
fortune? Who will revive and reissuc it? What renown shall await him ἔ ”
Pincier alone cssays to gain the prize, and by his skill saves the work from oblivion.
Rejoiee then in the prize, that the farne and glory of your name may be everlasting.

Another.

Cynthius is Urania’s care, like the other lights and fiery constellations that rule
the sky. Who knows not that Urania is Phoebus' care? Pincier is the care os both,
renowncd lor his mental powers. Urania has shown him the paths of the San, but
Phoebus has taught him the truc Pierian note. Hence your easy poetic style and
sweet strain, worthy of the bards of old. llere you see the true marks os both
when, Buchanan, hc carcsully adorus your sphaera. So may the Muses, Apollo,
and kindly stars favour your task.

Juhn Johnston‚ not ‘⁴ Dr.,'' as Mackenzie styles him, the source of much confusion.
