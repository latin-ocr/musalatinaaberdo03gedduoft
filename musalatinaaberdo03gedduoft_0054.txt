Vl. APOBATERION, 01< LAST FAREWELL TO ABERDEEN.

Bai-clay's ⁴ FarewelL' οῖ’ which no copy had been known to Joseph Robertson or to Stuart
(spald. Club Miscell. i. 75), was communicatcd by Mr. Kallas Johnstone‚ whose knowledge of
the city and its sons quite equals Barclay's regard sor it, to Scottish Nares and Querics soi-July,
1904. The lines occur in 3 unique copy. 3 ῑὶιίη octavo os eight leaves, without pagination, in
the British Muscam. lt is entitled Gnil. Barclnyi Amocniorum Artium c! Mcdicmue Doctoris
Sylvac Tres. Ifdinlturgi ‹zwmlcbat Andri-as Han, Anno 1619. Besides the dedication in
Latin prosc and vei-se to the Com-t os Session, it contains the Apobatcrion and the two poems
rcprinted in the I)‹·l. Paci. Scol. i. pp. 137—39. Tattered fragments os the Syl-eae also exist in
the Bodleian.

It is remarkable that Barchiy, the Catholic, enumerates as the lights os the city four Pro-
testants. 'l'he first is clcnrly Bishop Patrick Forbes (Funcmls, cd. 1845. pp. lxxv.-lxxvii.).
The second place may be claimed either sor his son Dr> John Forbes, or for Dr. Wm. Forbes,
fourth l'rincipal ot' Marischal College (Musa, vol. ii. p. 26). David Wedderburn (35-7) is
possibly felested to as the third. 'she fourth can hardly be stated with accuracy.
