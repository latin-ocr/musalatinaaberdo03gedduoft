‘⁸ l'ai'tner,yy said Liddel, “no more. The love of you and yours carries me here.
Fired of old with the desii-e of fame, when 1 was leaving my native land, 1 often
beheltl it with tcars. Do 1 then quit you, land os my fathers, myhome, my friends?
Wherever 1 roam, whatever vicissitudcs await me, 'oe you, my native country, ever

my native city. Gerinany could never allure this from my thoughts, 1 devote all

while the heavenly host sang the song of victory, with sevenfold blended voices, with
trumpets’ blare and clang of cymbals.

ΙΙ. LIDDELI A POTHEOSIS.

Salve sancta domus, sanctae salvete phalanges
Caelituum, novus en hospes, saera limina caeli
Pandite et ad superas animam hane transmittite sedes.
Vix haee celsa animam Liddeli- ad sidera ducit

5 Angelus, ecee alacri concurrunt murmure Divi,
Unde sit, exquirunt. Liddeli at nomen ut aures
Perculit, agnoscunt: animae nam praevia fama
Iam prius aethereas Superum penetraverat aedes.
Ergo ut caeli aditus quo sit reserandus honore

10 perspiciant, Christus Divum pater atque hominum rex
Consilio in medio verbis ita fatur amicis:

Maxima res agitur, Superi, mortalia passim

Corda sopore iacent alto prostrata, nec usquam
Verus amor spirat fideive potentia verae.

15 Cumque sit angusti spatii conclusa periclis
Vita homini et dubiis malefidi legibus aevi,
Disserit iste, fidem non exserit, illa parentum
Primorum rediviva animum dum fascinat audax
Ambitio, praecepsque ruit dum scire laborat.

20 At vero is, vestro quem iam dignamur honore,

¹ This must be the sense, though indiga should mean ‘⁴ no age shall stand in need of our
same.'' z'.c. your surpaszing merit eclipses us for ever.
