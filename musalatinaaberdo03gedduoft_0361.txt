JOllN RAv. 311

Phoebus, with golden Astraea, Minerva's great stay, has lest the earth. The Mitrc
bewails the removal from earth os Forbes, Lem-ming and Law lanient him. One
consolation remains; the holy image of his great sire in heaven has been lest alive
on earth, in the person of his son, John.

11. LAMENT FOR WILLIAM, EARL MARISCHAL.

ΑπουΜιιΝτ.

Heraclitus sadly wept at everything‚ and the sago of Abdera laughcd at them.
Muses, assume the visage of Heraclitus, the laughter of Democritus suits you not.
Tears, groans and the dirge suit the Muses in rnourning. A double cause, alas,
returns. The scion of Parnassus scarce numbers as many Olympiads as Phoebus in
his passage through the Zodiac. When the chief of the Keiths, the star of the
realm, the sure stay and chief glory of the Pierian quire, drops in old age, the
Musesjustly wail him. Alas! the image os his great sire lies low,f1ve lustra younger
than his glorious parent, nor has the splendid deseent shone so everlastingly
through the centuries as the year in its double course numbers days. His race,
faithful to king and country, his noble spouse, his royal seed, his high honour and
dreaded power—the one borne without pride, the other blamelessly—could not keep
hirn, nor do his wide domains save him, and none greater than Keith in broad
Scotland, nor his comely form and skill in arms. His frankness, his weighty elo-
quence‚ his freedom from all bitterness of spirit and his munificence to his father's
foundation protected him not. What the father gave, the son granted again.
Medical skill, the prayers of the Church and the Muses availed not. He has fallen,
the prop and boast of the University. taken away by too early a death. He has not
perished, his life triumphs in happiness with the gods, his great fame will survive
this darling of the Muses. He lives in the great son of a great father, and may he
live to bless his University‚ the nobles' hope, his country's ornament, and the happy
pillar of the Muses.

Ι. PATRICII FORBESII EPICEDIUM.

[Forbes' Funerals, 1635.]

Cynthiae quid nuper tenebrosa expalluit umbra?
Insolito riguit terra nivosa gelu?

Corruit et sacri quid celsa corona Lycaei,
Quidve Dicasterii turbine ruptus apex?

Si qua fides vero est, monstrabant vulnera terrae,
Caelum, bruma, forum, celsa ruina domus.

Entheus heu Phoebus terras, Astraea reliquit
Aurea, Cecropiae magna columna deae.

Forbesium abductum terris hunc infula deflet,
