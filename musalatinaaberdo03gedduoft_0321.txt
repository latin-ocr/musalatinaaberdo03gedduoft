XV. TEARS AT THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE MOST
AUGUST MONARCH, JAMES 1., KING OF GREAT
BRITAIN‚ FRANCE, AND IRELAND, FROM 1115 OWN
COUNTRY OF SCOTLAND INTO ENGLAND.

The lines have been copied from the fragment, preserved in the interesting lx'irkwall
Bibliotheck, which has been sorwarded by the courtesy of the Rev. J. Craven of St. Olafs,
Kirkwall. They l'orm one of the countless eulogies showered on the British Solomon during
his extraordinary return visit to Scotland. (See VVedrkrbmn's Syncuphmaterian, Introduc-
tion.) The theme is everywhere treated with the same hyperbolical laudatiori os James and the
declaration that nature is staggered by his return to lingland, the stars being about to fall and
the angels weeping. Those who reject the absurd sycophancy have not, perhaps, read the
similar est‘usions by greater men and by better‹remembered names in the Dclitiac Poetarum
Scotorum, or even the equally absurd flattery of Raleigh (Kcnilworth, Note 15) to Elizabeth.
Leech's attempt to reach the royal ear clearly failed. His relative, Robcrt Baton, at St.
Andrews in the same year had much better fos-tunc, having taken the precaution to attack the
monarch on his weakest spot, his theological vanity (Shand's Frmerals, p. 27). It is significant
that all through Leech has nothing to say on this side of Jamcs’s character, so fully dealt with
by Wedderburn.

XVI. DAPHNIS.

The first 117 lines are taken from the Daphnis, in the fragment at Kirkwall, printed with
the Lachrymac. The rest os the extract has been added {rom the Second of the Eslogae
Bucolicae, in which it appears in a slightly altered version worked up sor the 1620 volume.
Leech is Lycidas and Alexander of Menstrie, later on Earl of Sdrling, is Alexis. King James
VI. is Daphnis. It is the traditional pastoral, in imitation of Virgil's Eclogues. For a
character of Stirling and his poetry, see Musa, i. 219. ‘¹ Tragedies of ostentatious morality.
diffused through smooth rhetorical stanzas, without a spark of celestial fire'' (Douglas'
Peerage, ii. 536). Leech (Ecl. Bne. p. 2) addresses him thus :—

¹⁴ Tantum divine poeta,
Vatum O grande decus, paulum Thameseia rura
Desere, et Aeschyleo temet furare cothurno,
Dum tuus agrestem Lycidas percurret avenam.’¹

On p. 5 the “iuga consita spinis,’' associated with Damon, the “spinifer Damon ’¹ os p. 24,
in the Fifth Eclogue, refer to Drummond os Hawffiornden, whose sels-chosen designation it
was for his own epitaph.
