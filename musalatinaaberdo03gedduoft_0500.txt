osa vacancy sor a teacher at Carpentras. The bishop was Jacopo Sadoleto, Apostolic Sec-
retary under Leo X. and Clement VII. ‘'Nothing was so rnuch at heart with the Italian
scholars as to write a Latin style, not only free from barbarism, but conformable to the standard
of what is called the Augustan age. A uniform goodness of beart and love of right prevail in
the epistles of Sadolet. His desire of ecclesiastical reformation in respect of morals has caused
him to be suspected os a bias towards l'rotestantism '¹ (Hallam, Liter. ofEnropc‚ ch. v. ξ 2 ιι).
The stranger appeared late :it night in the library (Sadoleti, Epistulae, Lugduni, 1554, lib. vi.
Ep. 3), and by his Latinity and bearing so engaged the attention os the bishop that he was at
once engaged sor the post, at the salary os seventy crowns a year. The whole incident is
remarkable as showing the use of Latin, with the Scottis-h pronunciation, as the great litei-ary
language os Europe employed by scholars and men of affairs, and by the Scots abroad,

1550, publihed the Latin Bihlc—an edition remarkable, even in an age when printers’ readers
were scholars, sor the fewness os the errors. as well as sor the magnificence os the type. From
this press, too, issued the great “Commentariorum Linguae Latinae ’¹ of Dolet, a two-volume
solio os ῃὸυω columns each, with but eight errata sor the whole work. Three hundred works,
more than enough to make :i goodly list of a great English publishing firm in the days when

Rouncl this great printer was gathered a Society—the Societe Angelique—ol‘scholars and poets
which offered the noblest welcome and the largest liberality to a rnan os scholarship and of ad-
vancctl opinions. That is to say, for a few years only the advanced opinions were accepted:

interesting to lind Wilson in this society, though his religious opinions were not those os
such men as Dolet and Bonaventure Desperiers. Du Bellay had been the patron both of
itabelais and Wilson.
