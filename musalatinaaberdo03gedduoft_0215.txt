ll. AENEAS BRITANNICUS.

These survi-ling lines of the poem have been this year (1907) discovered by Mr. J. 1³.
Kellas Johustone among sorne papers and loosc sheets which had found their way to the
University Library together with a bundle of old books. Though no name osa printer appears
on the title-page, the type appears clearly to be that os John Forbes.

At the Resioration, the Michaelmas clection of the Town Council was carried out in
conformity with a letter from Chancellor (ilencairn. who pressed that none be elected who
had in any way been disaffected to the King since 1651). To this the members consorined,
the Provost being sent to London with a congratulatory address to the King srom the Council,
the second address sent by them since his return. ln Feb, 1661 the limb of Montrose was
removed from the Church of St. Nicholas, and handed over to Harie Graham, son os the
Laird of Morphie. The hand and arm were disinterred and placed in a crimson-lined bOX.
and were conveyed with military honours to the Town House, for Edinburgh (Munro's Alder-

TO THE AUTHOR VIRGILIZING.

The edict ran. so says report, that none but. Apelles should paint Alexander the
Great. What author could be meet for Charles, what pen⁷ what heavenly fire, what
wit, what judgment? Unless Virgil's muse, revived through you, Kennedy, grantsyou
to sing of Charles in lostier vein. Virgil, king of singers and the Muses' darling, wove
in happy song Aeneas’ deeds. Kennedy, that he may in a revived strain sing the
praise of Charles, a constant love for the King has impelled you. Virgil hid Aeneas
