Ptolemy, has proved she has stood for one thousand and five hundred years, yet
never through those years has she attained a greater boon. For you are her second

renew the foundations of our city. Nor was this enough; noble knights have been

IV. PROPEMPTICON CHARITUM ABREDONENSIUM.

[Delitiac Poetarum Scotorum, ii. 566-69.]

Siste rotas, currus ferventes siste, querelis

Et lachrymis impende moram, quas fundere moeror
Rex abeunte iubet ; brevis haec, modo poscere fas sit.
Vosque Deae, aurigae regis, fluitantia lora

5 Et volucres inhibete axes. Anne hostica tellus
Quae vobis linquenda est ? Sin dulcedine regem
Patria nec mulcet solita nec cura suorum,

Nec lachrymae miseris confusae questibus udae,
Sed si certa animo regi sententia sedit,

10 Natali remeare solo, felicibus oro
Auspiciis pergat, cedens felicibus arvis.

Ast unum sine fraude mihi fas poscere regem,
Dum properat, lentus properet spatiumque loquaci
Vel modicum nostro velit indulgere labori.

15 Haec ubi praecursor, referunt sua lumina Divae,
Primaque Religio, quam mystae et psallere docti
Circumdant; horum vox aurea missa per astra
Innumeros numeros et non imitabile carmen
Sic ciet ut philomela homini prius aemula cedat,

20 Threiciumque sui pudeat, se iudice, vatem.
