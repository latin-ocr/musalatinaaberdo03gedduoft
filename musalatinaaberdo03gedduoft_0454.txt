404 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

royal Peacemaker everywhere aims at peaceful measures by friendly counsel. Bent
on higher things, he solves knotty points in law or thunders in eloquence to the
admiration of his courtiers, who behold in him a revived Pericles or Nestor. Or he
meditates a divine book of deathless renown, teaching the son the duties of a
ruler; condemning magic, attacking the Indian weed, destroying the Capitol, hurling
back the weapons of Torum, and repelling force by force. Let Baron shew himself
in all his genius and power, and recall his opening fame. Scarce does one whole
age produce a worthy bard; to wear the laurel, as king of men and high priest of
poem, is not this true glory for an age ? Why dally over merits that cannot be over-
praised? Look at the man‘s life; have we not here the Idea of the Good? David
stained his piety with adultery. He has taught us what rewards await chaste
kingS.

’Tis an age of party strife. Some defend the camp of Rome with sword, argu-
ment and prison; others attack it. In the quarrel truth perishes, to all he was the
same. The teaching os Constantine and the old uncorrupted primitive ages he
turned over day and night. He increased the means os the clergy3 his end was
like his life. Few kings die a natural death. The blood of kings is as the Milky
XVay, thick strown with violent deaths. Pompey attests this, and the towering heads
at Romecut down by the sword. Foreknowing his end, he first completcd the needs
of Church and State3 then, as is gently falling asleep, he calmly met the blow, in
the guise of death putting on immortality‚ with an angel quire following. Nearest
was Maurice of Nassau.

Meanwhile one might see the Muses in tears. Dowu from his head Apollo
casts the laurel, the Dryades cannot assuage their grief, Erin strikcs an endless note
of woe. Father Forth rushes to the main, reckless of man and shipping in his
grief. Bon-Accord beyond all others shows herself in grief, pleasing in her name
and what that name implied. With the son she consoles herself.

Edessed are the peacemakcrs.¹
-(Epitaph of the Most Serene King, James VI.)

Best of kings, you have surpassed all praise; virtue and praise cannot further go.
Not James the Sixth, but James the First, a semi-divine man and a semi-human god.

A notker.

If one small ring contains the graven names of the better kings, you lare the
gem or centre piece. As Archimedes invented the sphere, involving in it the mighty
frame of the world, so in your life and death (a sort of compendium of all praise> is
all that is brilliant in the world.

Vos Buchananei manes quibus enthea quondam
Vis dedit ingenii divino carmine totum

Natales, Iacobe, tuos celebrare per orbem,
Vosque, O Bartasides, Gallorum gloria, Musae,
