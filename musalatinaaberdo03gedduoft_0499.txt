F LORENCE WILSON.

The name of this writer, perhaps after John Vaus the earliest contributor to the volume,
is uncertain. Traditionally he is styled Florence VVilson, and the earliest sketch os him is
found in ’ὼε works of l’atrick Adamson, Archbishop os St. Andrews, in the additions to liis
poemata Sacra, London, 1619, edited by that writer's son-in-lnw, Thomas XVilson, advocate
(MA. St. Andrews. 1577, ‘¹ in coll. novo'': Andrcw Mclvillc, M‘Crie, p. 79 n.). The writer
may have had personal knowledge for his statements, but the matter is complicated by the
fact that, in writing to Thomas Cromwell from Paris, he styles himself Florencc Voluzene.
But it is not improbable, as Dr. Irving conjectures, that the name follows the French form of
Vulson, borne by a Scottrsh family in Daupliine, and that the name once Latinised was retained
by the writer even in an English letter.

He was born, says Thomas Wilson, “parentibus ingenui-<¹¹ near the river Lossie, and
was educated doubtless at the Cathedral School of Elgin. His birth may be referred to 1504 or
1500. and he has lest us a sketch of himself (Dc An. Tran. ed. 1751, p. roo) and liis friend John
Ogilvie, rector os Cruden, walking on the banks of that river. The same biographer is the sole
authority for saying he was educated at King’s College. then recently founded. He procaeded
from Aberdeen to Paris, a step that may have been taken by the advice os the staff, entirely,
or mostly educated there; or he may have availed himself of the connection existing be-
tween Pasis and Moray in the Scots College, which had been founded by its hishop in 1326 to
meet the educational wants of students from his diwcese (Hume Brown. History, i. 208).

ln Paris he became acquainted with the nephew, or the reputed son, of Cardinal WVoloey,
Thomas Wynter, Dean of Weus. to whom he acted as tutor from 1528 to 1530. Other patrous
he found in the French capital, such as Cardinal Jean de Lorraine. and Jean du Beliay, Bishop
of Paris, of the well-known family associated with Rabelais. In the service of Wolsey he had
also made the acquaintance of Thomas Croniwellv and letters exist from Wilson to that states-
man (Bannaiyne Miscellany, 1827, vol. i. 331-36). He was in England more than once, and
in 1534 he mentions his walking in the garden of his friend Antonio Bonvisi3 one clue con-
nects him curiously enough with the north. There is a letter on a fly leaf of Erasmus's Apoph-
thegmata which he sent to John Ogilvie, at Cruden, asking atter old friends and Hector Boece
in particular. These dates fix the visit to 1534. The book has upon its title page ⁴* william
Forbes of Tolquhon, 1588 '¹ (Notes anti Qucries, 1oth September, 1859). It is possible he may
have then revisited the north.

The divorce ease of Henry VIII. was then being tried in the papal conns, and XVilson’s
patron Bellay interes-ted himself in an attempt to essect a reconciliation with Pope Clement
VII„ in hope of averting the impending crisis in the Church. The cardinal and his party left
Paris for Rome, in July, 1535, and the event is noteworthy from the fact that Rabelais formed

one of the band. Wilson was lest behind, starting, however, for Italy, which he had long de<
sired to see, in September. At Avignon his means were exhausted‚ when he fortunately heard
