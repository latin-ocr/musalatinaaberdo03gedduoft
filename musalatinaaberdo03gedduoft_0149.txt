ιιοιιΝ JOHNSTON. 107

XVI.
George Hay.

After the Muses at home trained him, cultured Paris received him. Rich with
the spoils of Greece and the East, he returned. A lively wit was aceompanIed hy
eloquence. Striving to leave his children rich at death, they say he set private he-
fore public intercst. I’iety is ever the best patrimony.

XVII.
John Macbray‚ exile ln Germany, Belgium, England, 1558.

The evil spirit of the Komish Chureh drove me from my c‹)unt1·y; England
cherishes me. 'l'he storm that broke at the death of Edward VI. seizes me. No
danger, no toil daunts me, as the Belgian, the German, the Englishman can testil'y.

Mat-bray addresses John nale, who placed him while alive in the Thmclrc os
Illustrions Writers.

A friend in need is a friend indeed. So have 1 ever found in Bale, who makes
my fame everlasting. My life at death is dne to him.

XVIII.
Walter Min, martyr at St. Andrews, April 28, 1558.

Who could think the old man so hrave as to show no fear of the handed mass-
makers and the hellish wolf? The stake and prison have no tei-sors for him.
who can deny there is hcavenly strength to mortal man? The carthly srame is
nothing. A hidden spark spreads immensely; so shines the glory of God.

Not our impiety nor our past life has armed our foes against us. The saith of

Christ, the source of life, is the cause of death.

XIX.
Adam Han-iot, minister of Aberdeen, died August 28, 1574.

Hariot, I respect you as a father, who baptised me, who showed me, when
scarce a boy, the way to mansions in the skies. These lilies and violets are the
pledges of our love.

(2-)

The rnan who (Orpheus like) could move woods by his voice, who could stir
stones by his heart-moving eloquence, who could sway hither and thither the still
more obdurate minds of men—this is Hariot, the soul of learning.

XX.
william cai-michael, Rector of the Grammar School, minister of St. Fittick's-
across Dee, my master : died about Aug. 1, 1581.

&Vhen the Sun has reared his bright head, the barbarous mol) hides its face.
What mob? That reared on the fall os Rome. rustling In the panoply of a barbarous
empire3 the race that corrupted the pure sounts and whelrned good arts. He opens
again the pure waters and brings back the Sun. Alas that darkness should extinguish
such a Sun l He shines while Sun and light do.
