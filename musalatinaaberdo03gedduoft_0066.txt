the light of his country, worthy of our great honour. Far away, he kept before his
eyes his country, his bre-thren, :md his Alma Mater. 1 pray then, that his honour

Extitnt vt quondam Ioseph fratrumque domusque
131 patris et patriae vita salusque suae,
Scintillae primo similis, mox lampadis instar
Fulsit in ignoto gloria prima solo.
5 Haud aliter magno nobis cumulandus honore
Rnuws adest, patriae fulgida flamma suae.
Qui patriam fratresque suos almamque parentem,
Ante oculos habuit dum procul ipse fuit.
Illius crgo precor [steterit dum sama perennis
10 Matris Antiimoxmz] stet bene fultus honos.
