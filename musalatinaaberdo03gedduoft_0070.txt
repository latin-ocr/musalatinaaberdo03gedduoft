That everie one might fruiet find of that wark ε
With whom CARfflLL thy answer thus refound,
If ignorante obscuritie would mark.
Thy art to light is come, but not espyit,
Save evin by such as worthelie can wey it.

M. W. BARCLAY.
The following are on the next leaf in another hand-

Ane answer to his unknown friend whom he wisheth
with all his hart to know-e.

Although that Vcrtue soveranc, l and Love bene most conding
For to have praisey and gaino rcnown Ι above all earthlie thing,
VVherethrough is gott, as men deservo, Ι of right eternall name,
Thai tract of tymc can not destroy, 1 or blot away the same,
My freind of laitt, unknowin yit, Ι Ι hold me close a whyill.
If oght 1 can, whill tyinc may serve 1 to utter furth my styill,
1x1>vscribling,an‹1 unskilsull pen 1 hath brought now to an end
'she worke which 1 unto your fyill l most glaidlie wold commend.
Scri that μ· urge, and uthcrs so Ι no longer to delay,
If that iny Musc will grant rne ayd, 1 1 shall do as 1 may.
1 have not (lrunkt of Helicon, Ι nor hant Parnassus hill,
1³01- to profess in l'oesie Ι that I have art, or skill.
But as now this, now that did move, l ancl sancio tuik delytt
Xthn tyinc was ,ἥκῃ-(1(- from grytcr cares 1 Ι usde sum thing to wryt,
And not so much in to this sort, Ι where vulgar toung is hard,
As in the Latin most to frame Ι 1 had alway rcgard,
Ι thani< yow for your coum-sic Ι til! Ι may know, or sic
My loving freind, which lox-ing me Ι hath wrytt thus unto mc.

A coniceture of this his unknown freind

As cverie man (loth use the termes } belonging to his art
My freind 1 think a Fau-lar ¹ bene Ι a Poet most cxpcrt
With falcon ssight acquentit well Ι such thing his words doth say
And for his skill he worthie is Ι to weare the Laurell bay.
