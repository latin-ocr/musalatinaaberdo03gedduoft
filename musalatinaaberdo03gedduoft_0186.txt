Idem hostis iudexque simul. Pro crimine, Christi
Religio, et foedo crimine pura manus.

Malvillus. For the form os name and origin, see Johnston. s.v, “ Richard Melville '. The
lines are quoted by M⁴Crie (Knox, p. 80), who adds: ‘⁸ Sir John Melville of Raith, a gentleman
of distinguished probity, and os untainted loyasty, was accused ofa traitorous connection with
the enemy, and although the only evidence adduced in support of the charge was a letter
written by him to one of his sons then in England, and though this letter contained nothing
criminal, yet was he unjustly condemned and beheaded.'' See Buchanan, xv. 65.

Heros Magnificus Urbis Abredonensis Praefectus moritur xii. Cal. Ianuari, ΑΟ Christi,
1576.
Qui priscis gaudens titulis et iure vetusto
Inter tot claros eminet unus avos,
Clarae urbis praelustris honos, princepsque, caputque,
Fama, cultu, animis quae praeit una aliis.
5 Magnifieis opibus, numeroque potente clientum,
Prole, nuru, et generis clara frequensque domus,
Haec pueri in patria quondam nos vidimus. Eheu !
Quo rerum specics illa decorque abiit ?
Semina adhuc divina domus generisque supersunt,
10 Sanguinis et noscunt secula prisca notas.
Disce vices rerum. Tanta haec mutare vetustas
Evaluit, quae stant iam quoque regna ruent.
