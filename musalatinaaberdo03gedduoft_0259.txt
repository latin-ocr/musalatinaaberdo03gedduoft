JOHN KER.

He shrinks srom its use, and he dreads but to bon-tow
His own soi· a moment to lessen his pclf,
'l’he poor sordid wretch thus increasing his sorrow,
Os others regardless and most of himself.
Not such was my Fimssa, the mother's hcart cheering
With bounty that fully her labour repays;
Himsclf by his action thus doubly endearing‚
With hand ever open the wretched to raise.
ln my hour of deep sorrow when, languid and weary,
And strichen in years sore dejected 1 lay ;
&Vhen no ray of hope yet arose on the dreary
Dark night that beset me and loured on my way;
''l'is he that revisits his home with a blessing,
Sole son of my many to me that was true:
My youth he restores and in accents cares-sing
ssids fresh blooming shoots now arisc to the view.
Fled far is our shaine3 for with soft splendour beaming
Mark our halls in their beauty that dazzle the sight,
With inarble of Paros our columns are gleamfflg,
And all the quadrangle is statcly and bright.
In the brave days of old ’twas a King by his orders
Erected our home, and we yet bear the narne;
But now, where the Don round encircles our borders
With Dee for companion, be Fmsm’s the fame.
Let the piles of old Egypt confess here our glory‚
And own in the raee they are far left behind,
Let the boast be no more of their age and their story—
If theirs show the handiwork, ours add the mind.
Our Library, too, owns that bountiful hand,
For scanty and few were our treasures before ;
To its keeper a bursary comes by command,

Ofthe ‘⁶ lads o' pairts pregnant '’ increasing the store.

Not on me or mine only such blessing descensis,
But others his bounty can feel and declare;
To his kin and his name the most constant of friends,
They all knew his hand and his fostering care.
Nor yet while the poor and the needy he feeds
From self what is needful and just he wsthdrew:
In regardmg his own and of others the needs
He would show that his balance was even and true.
To thee has high Heaven great fortune decreed,
To thee too the art of enjoying resigned,
And from thee let the miser and spendthrift agreed
For once know the truth of that well-balanced mind.
