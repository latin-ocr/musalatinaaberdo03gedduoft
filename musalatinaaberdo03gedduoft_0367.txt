E Germanico. (From the German.)

children.

Me locabis evirandum, ni sequantur liberi.

ΙΙ. ΟΝ SIDNEY'S ARCADIA.

A sequence of epigrams on Sir Philip Sidney and the Arcadia, doubtless due to Reid's
intimacy with Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, who described the poet as “ the common ren-
dezvous of worth in his time ”. An epigram on Sidney by Chaneellor John Maitland will be
found in the Del. Post. Scot. ii. 138, and one by George Thomson, ii. 530, on the Chariclea ot
the Aethiopica. The English writer's work was founded on ⁴* Sannazaro's beautiful model of
a pastoral romance‚'' as Hallam calls it, and on a translation of Heliodorus published a short
time before; but, like Cervantes' Galatea (1584) and the Diana os Montemayor, its importance
now is rnore historical than literary. Perhaps the equality of Sidney with the Greel: and
Latin wits, in the seventh epigram, refers to Drayton's eulogy on Sidney for withstanding the
bad taste of Euphuism. Sidney, he says :--

“ Thoroughly paced our language as to show
That plenteous English hand-in-hand might go
With Greek and Latin, and did first reduce
Our tongue from Lyly's writings then in use.‘'

See the balancedjudgment of Hallam (Litcrat. ch. xvi. sect. iii. 36, 46) on the Arcadian cycle
in literature.

The Aethiopica in ten books of Heliodorus, rightly or wrongly assigned to the Bishop of
Tricca in Thessaly (fl. Α.[>, 390), relates the love of Chariclea, daughter of Hydaspes, King of
Aethiopia, for Theagenes, a Thessaliam of rank. It had a great vogue and influenced all the
writers of pastorals. Sidney (Defencc of Pocsie) uses it to define poetry as essentially con-
sisting in the thought and not in the form of verse ; Theobald shows it known to Shakespeare.
Twelftlt Night, v. i. 121.

The Arcadia was early known in Scotland. A third edition was published by Robert
Waldegrave at Edinburgh in 1599. The Earl of Stirling tried a sequel (Masson's Drummond
osHawthorndcn, pp. 85, 259).
