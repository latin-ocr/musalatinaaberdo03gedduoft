wierAM JOHNSTON. 163

Crux mihi praesidium suerat, medicina doloris,
10 Antidotum mortis, Spes mea, vita, salus.
Iam resonat super astra crucem pars optima nostri,
Aceinit angelicus me modulante chorus.
Dumque meum claudent fatalia marmora corpus,
Laeta celebrabunt marmora nostra crucem,
15 Ut qui nascentur post saecula multa nepotes
Ossibus in nostris haec monumenta legant.
Amoris debiti et moeroris symbolum posuit.
Gul. Ionstonus, MD.

7. Play on Cross and Corse, by usual metathesis :—

‘ Α Crosse into His Badge Hee bore!

ιο, Salus. ⁸⁴ It would seem that the family os Corse at this time used the mono, Salus
per Christum, :is it appears on the monument. We are told by Nisbet [Edinburgh¹ solio„
1742, vol. i. p. 328], that the motto os the Corse branch os the family of Forbes is Rosis
coronat spina, under a wreath or crown of thoi-ns for erest, while the words on the bishop's
tombstone are assigned to the family os Forbes of Tolquhon and its branches, ibid. p. 529''
(Shand in 1545 Funerals, p. 4 n.).

ΙΙ. ΟΝ THE DOCTORATE OF THE MOST LEARNED ROBERT
BARON, MA„ MINISTER OF THE WORD OF GOD AT

MARISCHAL COLLEGE.

From Baron's Disputatio leeologica, 1627, pp. 3, 4, on which see Aberd. Quatcrcfnl.
Stud. Bibliography, p. 393. Baron was Μ.Α. St. Andrews, 1613; minister of Keith, and
Greysriars‚ Aberdeen; Prof. of Divinsty, Mar. Coll. 1625-39. and one os the “Aberdeen
DoctorS.’' In 1627 he became D.D. of King's College. For list of works, see Fasti Acad-
Mar. ii. 51. Sketch of life in Shand‘s Funrrals, pp. 26-29, and in Musa, i. 2⁴9- where the
absence os any portrait os Baron by Jamesone is noted.

ARGUMENT.

Let the Muses celebrate Phoebus, and the rnob of poets worship seigned deities.
Baron's headpiece is a treasure of Holy Scripture, the nectar of divine eloquence
flows from his lips. He is created Doctor, and interpreter ol' the holy volume, worthy
before of the title. Who shall sing him? The task is unfit for the strength of the
Muses, and is, Ι fancy, fitter for the strains of Ange-15.
