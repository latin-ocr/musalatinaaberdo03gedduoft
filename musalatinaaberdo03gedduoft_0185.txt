JOHN JOHNSTON. ¹43

Dum simul hosti instant, spernunt simul omnia; nemo
Dum cessisse velit, nec superesse valet.

Felices animae, tanto quas Patria luctu,
Quasque prior tollens Fama sub astra vehit !

Johnston would remember King james IV. as the founder os King‘s college, where the
inscription on the west front of the chapel before Flodden styles him ⁸* illustrissimus ac invictis-
simus,'' invicta in ro (Walker, Historicnl Νοίεε, p. 77).

5-6. Lines not unworthy of Scott's savourite two verses :—

‘* I‘ve seen Tweed's silver stream, shining in the sunny bearn,
Grow drumly and dark as he row’d on his way ”.

13. “How sleep the bravo, who sink to rest'' (Collins' Ode, 1746). Aberdeen sent to
Flodden twenty spcarrnen and six horsemen. For the watch at St. Fittick's, Torry, to prevent
expected English landing in the Bay os Nigg, in 1514, see Extracts from TA). Register, Spal.
Club, i. p. 92; G. M. Fraser’s Historical Aberdeen, p. 37‘

VI. DAVID LYNDESI US.

Montanus Eques, Fecialiumque Princeps, Quem Regem armorum vocant, Poesi Scoti-
cana, varia eruditione et verae Religionis laude clarus, jacobo IV. et Jacobo V. Regibus
familiaris, floruit A. Christi 1540 (printed in Musa, ii. 247, and erroneously ascribed there to
Arthur Johnston).

Melliflui cantus siren dulcissima, qualern
Scotigenae Aonides et recinunt et amant.
Deliciae Regum, tituloque ae nomine regis;
Hoc fuerat nato quod fuit ante patri.
5 Quam musis carus, quam diis quoque regibus olim,
Tam vera placuit religione Deo.

2. ⁴‘ He attained at once to very great popularity, and for two centuries was what, down
to Burns, nobody else had been in the same degree—-the poet of the Scottish people. He
must materially have advanced the Reforming temper, if not the resorrned doctrines. He was
one of the influential Reformers who in 1547 urged Knox to become a preacher; yet he did not

join the Reformed congregation, and dying before the triumph of the cause, remained nomin-
ally at least a Catholic to the end '¹ (Dr. Patrick‚ Chambers‘ Cycl. Eng. Lit. i. 204).

VII. IOHANNES MALVILLUS, RETHIUS.

Nobilis Fifanus, Iacobo V Regi olim familiarissimus, summa vitae innocentia, ob purae
religionis studium, in suspicione falsi criminis, iniquissimo iudicio sublatus est A. Christi 1548.

Quidnam ego commerui? quae tanta iniuria facti,
Hostis ut in nostrum saeviat ense caput?
