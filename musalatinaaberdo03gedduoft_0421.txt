ΙΙΙ. GENERAL REJOICING ΟΝ THE RETURN OF THE
KING TO SCOTLAND, 1617.

“The king had promised that when State affairs permitted him to leave England he
would pay a visit to his native kingdom. That event was now at hand, and many preparations
for it were in progreSS, some of them not entirely propitious. . . . He lest behind him morsels
of serious work attended by recollections of a different order. The king attended a session os
the estates, who passed an Act sor persecting the structure of the new hierarchy by the restora-
tion of the Dean and Chapter os each See. The election os the bishop was to bc by the Crown
presenting and the Chapter electing the person so presented, atter the famous and illogical
method of the conge d’elire in England. A far more serious portion os the measure was the
restoration of the temporalities of the deanerieS, canomies and prcbends' stalls, so sar as these
temporalities could b:- recovered. In this we see a device sor widening the arena sor that grune
os seffishness, coercion and chicanery, which we have found in the dealings with the revenues
of the bishops'' (J. H. Burton, History. ch. lxvi.). For the gists of Church lands, and the
“wholesale bribery ” by this means of the nobles to support his policy in Scotland, see Hume
Brown, History os Scotland, ii. 240, 241.

James's visit, therefore, was as much sor business as sor pleasure. ⁴⁴ The King entered
Scotland on the 13th of May, 1617, and remain-:d there till the 5th of August, 1617. This
period was chiefly occupied in royal receptions and pageants of such meagre kind as Scotland
could assord. Comparing what we know οἱ these with the portly records of the great English
progresses, one would say that the ancient kingdom endeavoured to make up in intellect and
scholarship sor her deficiency in grandeur and substantinl hospitality. The scholarship of
Scotland was put under requisition for enlogistic addresses in all forms os Latin versification.
We have consequently to weigh against the substantial chronicles ofsestivals and costlypageants
a thin solio volume, chiefly filled with such productioris as will remiud its reader of College
exercises, though it is enlivened by one poem in the vernaculas, contributed by Drummond ot
Hawthornden ” (Burton, ad. loa). For his ecclesiastieal intrigues at the St. Andrews Conven-
tion, see Hume Brown, ii. 268, who thus sums up the royal visit: *‘ He had visited most of its
chief towns—Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Stirling, Glasgow and Dumfries—and in all of thern he
had been entertained at an expense beyond their means. He had had his fill of his favourite
pastime οἱ hunting; he had been celebrated in poenis in Latin and Greek, and in Scots ; and
he had been told in all forms of speech that he was the wisest and best of kings that ever sat
on a throne. At Dumfries, a farewell sermon was preached by the Bishop of Galloway,
⁸ which made the hearers to burst out in many tears ¹. Yet, indubitably, the collective prayer
of the nation was that the royal visit might not soon be repeated.'' He adds (p. 282) that ¹¹ on
the occasion of his visit in 1617 there was serious alarm in the Colleges of Edinburgh and
Aberdeen lest this sate (of suppression, confining the two Universities to the two archiepiscopal
seats os St. Andrews and Glasgow) should be in store for them: but their professors made
such a display of learning before his Majesty and so sostened his heart by their poetical effu-
sions that he was diverted from his purpose ”.

The memorial os the royal visit is extant in the folio mentioned by Burton above: ‘¹ The
Muses Welcome to the High and Mightie King James, at his M. Happie Return to his Old
and Native Kingdome of Scodand, after XIIII. Yeeres absence in Anno 1617 ”. Edinburgh,

1618, pp. 289, solio. It was edited by John Adamson, afterwards Principal of the University
of Edinburgh (lrving, Scotish Poets, ii. 2567 n).
