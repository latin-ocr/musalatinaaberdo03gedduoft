402 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

No man is a hero to his valet, and nothing can be added to the famous account of the royal
person by Sir Anthony Weldon, in the Annals of Sir James Balfour.

¹* His court‚'' says Burton, v. 373, “was the crew of Momus, without the seductive cup os
Circe that was employed to seduce better natures to the level os its degradation. To whoever
approached it, the eye and nostrils told of the abomination before he entered, and he made his
election in full consciousness of what it was. The meanness of those about him, his loathsome
familiarities with them, his diseased curiosity about the things that rightly-tempered minds
only approach at the bidding of necessity and duty, his propensity to stit whatever was rank
and ostensive, afforded to his malignant enemies the range over the whole scale of sensual vices
as their armoury. And yet there is reason to believe that he was not an unfaithful husband,
and that his only personal vice was in the bottle. Yet although his indulgence in drinking was.
like the other offences of his habits, not only undraped by any outward cover os decorum, but
in a manner prosusely thrust on the gaze of all men, it appears to have been superficial rather
than deep : he seems to have indulged in continuous soaking, after the German fashion, rather
than aster the manner of his own countrymen, to have reserved his powers for deep drinkingst

¹¹ His selected maxim was (Burton, v. 377) “ Blessed are the peacemakers ' ; and practically
he followed it in the neutral sense of avoiding the responsibility of war. How his mother's dis-
position and career were the reverse of this—how prone she was to strise and blood, and how it
had been permitted to her to curse the world by the exercise of her propensities, we have fully
seen. And yet, in comparison with her strange eventsul history, the peacesul tenor of her son's
reign loses the dignity that an eminent regal virtue should have bestowed on it. In truth his
pacific tendencies came forth in a form uncongenial to the period, and perhaps to all periods.
lt cxpressed itselfin personal timidity‚ and that was a detect so odious that no one could tolerate
it, so as patiently to examine what good influence there might be lurking behind itr Personally
he earncd the reward of his pacihc nature. He was the first monarch os his race since the
Jameses began who was permitted to reach the natural duration of his days.'’

l'eculiarly ludicrous and erroneous will appear lines 125, 126: ⁴‘ We possess too many cor-
roborative accounts of these entertainments to doubt that they were gross and indecorous. At
a feast given by Cecil at Theobalds the two mighty princes, James and Christian [his brother-
in-law‚ Christian IV. King os DenmarkJ, got so drunk that his English Majesty was carried to
bed in the arms of his courtiers. and his Danish majesty mistook his bed-chamber, and offered
the last of insults to the Countess οἱ Nottingham, the handsome and spirited wife of the Lord
lligh Admiral of England. But at the same great entertainment James's subjects, ladies as
well as gentlemen of the highest rank, gave proof that they were capable of following the
example of their sovereign. ⁸ Men,' says an eye—witness [Sir John Harington in the Nugae
Antiqua& ‘who had been shy of good liquor before now wallowed in beastly delights: the
ladies abandoned their sobriety and were seen to roll about in intoxication.' . . . James con-
tinued his lile of indolence and ease, hunting a good part of the year and lying in bed the
greater part of the day when he was not so pleasantly engaged. He even went so far as to say
that he would rather return to Scotland than be chained sor ever to the Council table. It was
rarely that his subjects could get access to him in his retreats. W'hen they did his address and
demeanour and appointments clashed strangely with the notion osa most royal and heaven-
descended prince, the image, as he called himself, of the God-head. He was dressed all over
in colours green as the grass, with a little seather in his cap and a horn instead of a sword by
his side. His queen, Anne of Denmark, was as fond of dancing and masks, fine dresses and
costly entertainmentS, as he was of hunting; nor had she, on the whole. much more personal
dignity than her husband ” (Blaekie’s Comprehensive History of England, iii. 313. 315).
