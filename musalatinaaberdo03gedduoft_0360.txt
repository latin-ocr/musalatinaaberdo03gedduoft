JOHN RAY.

Ray was MA. of Marischal College in 1625v and appears here by his designation as in
charge os the tertiari or third year class. He published [an edition os Cicero's Epistles “
(Ερἱίοίανιιηι, libri iv. Aberd. 1630). ‘⁴ He made an excellent funeral oration on King Charles
the Martyr. His brother, l)r. Ray. was nne learned Physitian, in the city ol Edinburgh. He
wrote also¹¹ (Maidment's Catalogucs, p. 120).

Spalding has two notices os him, and the latter to academie readers aware of that
chronicler's political and religious feelings must appear the gem os the book. “Vpone Son—
day, 15th May (1642). Mr. Johne Ray. one os the regentis within college Marschall, sitting at
the morning prayeiis in the New toun Kirk, suddanlie fell frenatick, and, rysing vp, eryitt

blood drawin, and becam solid sehortlie esterward ¹’ (ii. 142, 143).

quhairin tliay, bot punition. war crediblie keepit '' (ii. 274, ²75)· These two riotous magistrantis
os the 1640-1644 class (Fasti Acad. Mar. ii. 212) apparently resormed, though it was well for
them that Spalding lay so long in manuscript. Alexander Strachan (Simpson's Bon-Record,
p. 76) was appointed Master os the Grammar School 12th September, 1655: while Andrew
Cant, MA, 16⁴4, Minister os Liberton‚ 1659, became Principal os Edinburgh University, 1675.
He had been regent in Marischal College from 1649 to 1659.

Ι. DIRGE OF PATRICK FORBES.

ARGUMENT.

Why this late paleness of the moon, the unwontcd frost ? Why has the crown
os thc Collegc fallen, or the top os the tolbooth been crushcd by the wind? If we
trust the truth, the sky, the cold, the fall all shewed the wounds of the earth
