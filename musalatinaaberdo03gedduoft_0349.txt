Wl LLIAM MESTON.

Thc authoritative account of the life of Meston, the Jacobite IIudibrastic poet, is almost
entirely derived from the narrative prefixed to the edition of his works (oth edition, Edinb.
1767), published by Walter Ruddirnan, junior. 'she political and religious connection of the
publisher with the poet may be relied on for the accuracy of the sketch there given.

Meston was born ¹* about the year msa* son of the blacksmith at Midmar, in Aberdeen-
shire. The year cannot be taken literally‚ for he was a bajan at Marischal college in 1694
(Fasti Mar. Call. ii. 270), in which year he is found on the Register of the Grammar School,
as paying 14 p.. along with a William Leask for sarne sum, *¹ on their going to the Colledge ‘'.
He was Rolland Bursar. MA. in 1698, and was elected on Feb. 12, 1701, a master in the
Grammar School os Aberdeen. There ⁴⁴ the family of Marshal, being informed of his qualifi-
cations, took him under their wing‚ and made choice of him as preceptor or Governor to the
present Earl, and his brother the late Marshal Keith ¹⁸. This may have been at the Gramma:
School, where the ninth and last Earl Marischal and his brother were educated, being school-
fellows of Alexander Cruden of the ¹‘ Coneordance’² (¹⁴ Life of Cruden,'' by Alex. ehalmers,
Biograpltia Britannica, iv. 619, 2nd ed. London, 1789), or after Meston's demission of office at
the school on May 27. 1713. when he acted as private· tutor to the elder brother (MA. 1712),
and to the younger during 1714-15.

On Nov. 30, 1715, he was elected to a Regency in Marischal College, by the interest of
the Countess Maris-chal. He delivered τι public oration and a specimen in the Greek tongue,
but apparently he never taught (Fasti Mar. Coll. ii. 40), owing to the political troubles of the
time. “¹ Most unluckily for him, he thought proper to follow the fortunes of his noble patrons,
who made him Governor of Dunotter-castle.'' By the Royal Commission appointed to visit
Marischal College (Report, Dec. 21, 1716) the three Jacobite Regents, George Peacock, Alex-
ander Moir, William Smith, were deposed and with them fell Meston, who, it was proved, had
assisted the rebels with a drawn sword in his hand to proclaim the Pretender at the Cross of
Aberdeen, impugning the claim of the reigning house, and joining with his three colleagues
in delivering an address to the Pretender, as King JameS, at Fetteresso. He lurked in the
hills after the battle of Sheriffmuin till the publication of the Act of Indemnity.

⁴⁴ While the late Countess of Marshal was alive, he resided mostly in her family, where
he indulged his vein of pleasantry, to the entertainment of the company, who paid their
respect to her Ladyship: but upon her death he was left in a destitute situation. How
he disposed of himself immediately after, we have not with certainty learnt; but some
years afterwards he commenced an academy at Elgin.'’ There he taught the sons of the
Jacobite gentry of the district. ⁸· But economy was none of his talent. His friend, his bottle‚
and his book, were his sole enjoyments.''

From Elgin he removed to Turriff, thence to Montrose and Perth, being ⁴⁵ received into
the family of Mr. Oliphant of Gask, in quality of preceptor to his children. Here he continued
