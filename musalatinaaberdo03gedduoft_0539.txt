should regard this restoration as a pious duty, and should grane·
fully accept Mr. Kelly's offer to give the necessary help.

At the last Genera] Meeting of the Club the Rev. John
Milne, LL.D., moved that application be made to the proper
authorities to have the Enumeration Books os the 1841 Census
of Aberdeenshire placed in the custody of some responsible body
in Aberdeen; and the proposal was remitted to the Conncil sor
consideration. In compliance with this remit, inquiries were set
on soot, but were met by a reply from the Registrar General z
‘¹ These documents are os a confidential nature and your sugges-
tion sor the transfer os the books relating to Aberdeenshire to
Aberdeen cannot be entertained.’'

Since the last Report was submitted by the Council nine
members of the Club have died : Mr. William Brebner, Aberdeen z
Mr. George Moir Byres of Tonley; ΜΓ. james Leslie Fmser,
Inverness; Captain G. D. Clayhills Henderson‚ Dundce: the
Very Rev. Principal Lang, C.V.O.‚ one os the vice-Presidents;
Lieut.-Col. Henry W. Lumsden of Langley Park; Sir Arthur
Mitchell, K.C.B.‚ Edinburgh; Mr. Alexander Ramsay, LL.D.‚
Banff, a member os the Council ; Rev. Alexander Stewart, Murtle.

The places rendered vacant by some of these deaths have,
under Rule 9, been filled by representatives of the deceased
members, but other vacancies allow the admission of new mem-
bers. As new members are usually desirous of securing a full
set of the Club⁷s publications, it may be stated that although the
earlier issues are entirely out of print (as indicated on pp. 14-16)‚
the volumes occasionally corne into the market, and the Secretary
can usually direct a new member to a source whence they may
be obtained.

The Council wish to express their continued obligation to
the Society of Advocates for permitting the Annual General
Meeting of the Club to be held in the Society's Hall; and to
the Curator of the University Library for granting the use os a
room for Committee meetings.
