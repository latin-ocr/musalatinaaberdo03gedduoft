438 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Quid tibi vis, patulo tubus est cui semper in ore ?
Quid sibi vult fumus? Quid sibi flamma vorax?
Non hic Aetna ardens, non hic Trinacria tellus
Ignea flammiferos iactat ad astra globoS.
5 Aurea non tellus hic Colchica vellera condit,
Non hic Hesperidum carpere poma datur.
Pervigil ista draco flammis tutatus et illa est,
Quales usque tuo fumus ab ore vomit.
Ergo quid exhalas ignes quos Cacus ab antro
10 Fudit, Aventinis qui latuere iugis?
Tum Cacum Alcides unum modo comperit, atqui
Mille, eheu, Caeos saecula nostra vident.

What can tcars and notes os sorrow avail? I‘ious grief cannot conquer des-
tiny. Johnston will serve :is an example ς your votary, Phoebus, whether you play
the part of the physicicm or of the hard (Virgil), whether you plcasc to run over the
stass or count the tameless bays of thc sca. Ncither the strength of herbs, nor the
swcet sti-ains os the seul-moving bard may conquer destiny. O rare example, more
striking than the nim: times refmed gold ol' Ophir. Hi: was a second Euclid, nay
even in the llowcr ol* his youth a match for Archimede& Add that his mental
powers were accompanicd by intcgrity, blameless manners, and a wit that was
harmless. Evcr genial, stcady, serene, master os himself in any situation. No
more; be this. enough. Let it be the great praise os his great brother, Arthur‚ to
have sung him.
