DAVID WEDDERBURN 35 ι

Town Council gave hini 100 merks ‘⁴ to help to defray the greit ehairgcs quhairin he lic> been
drawin be his long attendance in Edinburgh, Sanct Andrews, and Glasgow, in the purches and
obteining of the councel and clergies os this kingdome, thair approbatioun and allowancc to
his new reformed grammor ’'. On the publication os the book, the Council on September η,
1632, gave him 200 merks Scots ¹¹ be resone os his dedicatioun of the same to the magistrattis
and Counsall ”. Α second edition was issued in 1637. On June 28, 1633, he petitioncd
Parliament for a monopoly, “desyring that the Short and Facile Grammar drawn vp be him
and his paine< may be allowit and ordanit to be taucht vniuersallie through all the skooles os
the Kingdome of Seotland and all vthers grammers dischargit to be taught withine the
samyne’' (Acts Part. Scol. v. 48 ; Miscell. Spald. Cluh, v. pp. 148, 1452.) ‘⁸ Its popularity must
have been considerable, for, so late as 1696, the Town Council of Edinburgh enacted that it
should be the text-book in the High School'’ (Mr. J. Kellas Johnston, in Abcrd. Quatcr.
Strzdies, p. 324), where it stood till superseded by Ruddiman in 1714.

In 1634 he issuetl his Institutiones Grammaticae (Raban, 1634, Aberd) with dedication to
Provost Sir Paul Mcnzies os Kinmundy, and to the Town Council. A second edition appeared
in 1635. The dedication is dated 1633 Kal. Maiis. He describes Abcrdeen as his “patria
sedes nunquam poenitenda; cum suo quodam Genio felicium ingeniorum secundissima Parent<
et sit et suerit¹'. He says of himself “tricesimus Dei beneficio annus iam agitur, cum for—
mandis et fingendis apud vos ingeniis operam navo‚” adding ⁴* aetatis meae iam ingravescentis ''.
Eight lines by Arthur Johnston follow.

In 1636 appeared his vocabula, cwn aliis Latinae linguae subsidiis, used up to 1700 in
the Grammar School. The Town Council on July 20, 1536, granted him ¹¹ fiftie pundis money
for his paynes in drawing vp of new vocables for the weill and benefite of the young schollares
within the said grammer schooll.''

His Persius Enuclcatus was published in 1664 by his youngest brother Alexander, at
Amsterdam.

Wedderburne, as may be seen from the Registers of the Couneil and from the list of
friends commemorated by him, such as Duncan Liddel, Arthur Johnston, George Jamesone
and others, held a prominent. place in the Aberdeen of the time. His poetical style lacks, of
course, the ease and finish, and the native aptitude for composition shown by Arthur Johnston,
and Wedderburne feels this in his elegiae reply to that master os the couplet. “No man
forgets his original trade‚¹' said Dr. Johnson feelingly os Milton, and the didactic tone is
apparent. But he oceupies an honoured place in the educational history of his native city, by
having secured sor it its long-continued and still unchallenged pre-eminente in Scotland for
Latin.
