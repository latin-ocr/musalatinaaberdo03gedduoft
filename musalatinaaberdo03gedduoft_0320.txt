270 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

XIV* IANI MALIFERI STRENA.

‘¹ Iani illalifcri Sirena : Calendis Ianuarii Anno Dom. 1617. Authore Ioanne Leochaeo
Celurcano Scoto. Edinburgi : Excudebat Thomas Finlason, 'l'ypographus R. M. anno Dom.
1617.‘’

For the careful transcriptos this poem, together with Nemesis Poctica, from the unique
copy in the library os the University os Edinburgh. 1 am indebted to the courtesy of my old
friend Professor Jarnes Mackintosh, 1,L.D. On the prominence of the First of January as an
era in the year, see the note in Musa, ii. 290. Ἰ he thing is slight in texture and shows
no great depth οἱ feeling or treatment, being rather an exhibition os his ⁴⁴ luxurians ingenium ''
as he styles it, and an illdigested mythological congeries, ¹⁴ Criticisrn,'' as Dr. Johnson said,
‘· disdains to chase a schoolboy to his commonplaces.” The Latin prose style in all his
dedications is artificia} and afi‘ectedly high flown, and contrasts most unsavourably with the
solitary specimen οῖ’ Ατῑὴω· ]οἰιηεῑοη, in the dedication of the Dclitiac to Sir John Scot.
The men were in every way distinct.

'l‘he religious attitude‚ if his perhaps slight belief is so stylcd, of Leech may be inserted
from his lines diffigmms, p. 8, 1620) on De Sculica Religionis Rry‘ornmtione, and from the
ecclesiastical company he kept, Lindsay of Brechin. and Spottiswoode. He probably attached
himself to the party that had promotIon and savours to offer, but the townsman os Andrew
Melville is certainly found in strange company in addressing the latter, ¹· Though it appears
some os the violent mensures os the Court were taken against his better judgment, yet he is,
perhaps, on that account. the more culpable, as he gave such violent courses his active sup-
port. He scrupled not to sacrifice his country's saith to his own ambition '' (Lippe's Wodrow,
297). That Spottiswoode with so much in his power did nothing for Leech is perhaps signi-
ficant, but it may only mean that that wily person was so engaged in pushing his own fortun&
and schemes as to sorget others. what his power was may be sully seen in the expose by
M·Crie of the Court os the High Commission (Andnw Mclvillc, p. 305), and in the letter of
his predecessor, Gladstanes. February 18. 1610. *ὕ Your majesty may look sor uniform and
constant service stom all my brethren, the prehtes, whom also your majesty will please to
encourage, partly when places in thc Session shall vaik by promoting some moe to the same,
whilk will both repair the decay of our livings and patrimony, and procure the dependence os
the rest of the ministry. who have their fortuni-s and [παῖς-ς subjcct to the pleasurc os chat
jmlicutory.” This power of receiving apponis and os inquisitorial investigation into schools
and colleges was the means wherehy Bishop Patrick Forbes formed his party in the north, so
lauded hy David Leech.

⁴l'he whole piece need not represent Leech's actual estimate os Spottiswoode‚ and the
retractation os his eulogy is too clear in the Ncmcsis Poctica, l. 241, to be mistaken. That
praesul indat-tiis could not say wath the other patron os Leech (l. 248) “bene habent se
singula? for the treatment is rambling. disproportionate. and too wordy in Ovidian manner-
isms. lt reads like a story os mythological tags. and recalls the criticism os Pindar by Corinna,
that in his 'l'heban mythology that writer had sown with the sack and not with the hand.

Leech has an epigram (Book iii. p. 65) to Laurence Skinner, on the Mala :—

’The Latin of xlm-xxm. is not given, in spite of the great rarity of Leech's longer
poenis ancl the curious satality that has attemled their disappearance from the British Museum
and Advocates' Library. But sor biographical purposes a brief account is appended of
each.
