192 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Dumque studet plumbum sacrato avellere Templo:
Horrendum sic ausa nefas (quis talia fando

60 Temperet a lachrymis Ξ) patrare, ausoque potita
Esset, magnanimus ni fortiter obvius isset
Andreades, nostri vindex nostrique Sacelli.

Nostra quoque archiva et servata ereptaque morti
Regales chartas, multa et diplomata monstrant.

65 Nec tamen et nobis finis suit ille malorum:
Insontes patria germanas pellere certant.
Exiliumque Themis patitur, Medicina fugatur,
Resque suas iussus sibi lastinianus habere,
Gregorinsqnc pater decreta auferre jubetur;

70 Hippocrntcsqnc senex pulsus, simul atque Galenus ,·
Orpheus et clarus cithara} fidibusque canoris
Flectere seu superos dirum aut Acheronta movere,
Non movet hos; ac ad delphinas missus Arion.
Sic laniata comas, artus laniata iacebat
