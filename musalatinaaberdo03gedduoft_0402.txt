HIGHEST HOPE, ELDEST SON OF JAMES VI.‚ MOST
SERENE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, IRELAND AND

FRANCE.

“Prince Henry, the heir to the Crown, had now entered his eighteenth year, and had
been for some time the idol of the people. If his character is fairly described by his contem-
poraries, he was entitled to this admiration ; but we cannot but remember the universal practice
of contrasting the heirvapparent with the actual occupant of the throne; and this prince's un-
timely end may very well have produced soi-ne of thrit exaggeration which arises out of
tenderness and hopeless regret. He was comely‚ well-made. gracesul, frank, brave and active.
Henry V. and Edward the Black Prinee were proposed to him as models; and it was the
example of those warlike princes that he determined to follow. Though not absolutely averse
to learning, spending two or three hours a day in his study, he loved arms better than books.
He employed a great part of his time in martial exerciseS, in handling the pike, throwing the
bar, shooting with the bow, vaulting and riding. He was a particular lover of horses, but not
ot hunting like his father.

‘⁸ In other particulars Prince Henry was strikingly contrasted with his parent . . . And
the High Church savourites iaxed him with being a patriot and a friend to the Puritans. . .
On the roth of October, 1612, Frederick V.. the Count Palatine, arrived in England to receive
his young bride. In the midst of the festive preparations for this marriage, Prince Henry,
who appears to have outgrown his strength, and to have greatly neglected the care of his
health, was seizcd with :i dangerous illness at Richmond, where he was preparing his house for
the reception of the Palatine. . . . His head frequently wandered, but on the night of the 2nd
of November his delirium increascd alarmingly: he called for his clotheS‚ for his armour and
sword, saying he must be gone. . . . His attendants thought him dead, and raised such a cry of
grief that it was heard by the pcople in the streets, who cchoed the loud lamentation. . . . He
expired at eight o'clock that night, being Friday, the oth of November, 1612. He was eighteen
years, eight months and severiteen days old. The people had not been made aware of his
danger till almost the last moment: their grief at his loss was unbounded; and all classes were
‚ dceply affected by the early death of the spirited youth. . . . James showed a brutal indifference
to the fate of his son. . . . In a very few days more he prohibited all persons from approaching
him in mourning, and he kept his Christmas with the usual festivities'' (Blackie's Compre-
lmasive History of England, iii. pp. 325, 326). Cf. Burton, History, v. 386, 388, for “the
hope of both nations.''

The Paragon of Princes, fairest Frame,

Time, Nature, Place, could show to morial Eyes,
ln WVorth. Wh, virtue, Miracle of Fame:

At least that Part the Earth of him could claim
This Marble holds (hard like the Destinies),

For as to his brave Sp'rst, and glorious Name,
The one the world, the other frus the Skies.
