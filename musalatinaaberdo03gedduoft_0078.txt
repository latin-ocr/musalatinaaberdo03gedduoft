THOMAS DEMPSTE R.

The life ol* Thomas Dempster, the first and greatest of¹ all the wandering scholars pro-
duced by the University of Aberdeen, has been written by himself. It reads like a romance,
and perhaps it is largely coloured by that quality. One scarcely knows what to make osa
man who, in the second line of his autobiography‚ gravely assures his readers that he was the
twenty-fourth child out of twenty-nine borne by the same mother to the same father. In the
title pages of his works Dempster styles himself ‘ Baro de Muresk: though he has not explained
the extraordinnry mortality among his predecessors iu the family circle by which he became
possessed of that barren title. There have been men who have, under the influence of family
pride, laboured under the idea that the histor)- of the GordonS, the ForbeseS, the Douglases,
constituted the history os Scotland. Dempster suffered srom the lues Dcmpstcriana. His
genealogy (i. 235) of Dempsters and Deemsters in the [sle os Man, liis infantile preeocity in
learning the alphabet in one hour in his third year, and much os what he has related about
himself, should not be taken too seriously. His enemies called him a liar. ¹ We have changed
all that‚’ and megalomania. obsession os one idea, and other phrases are now used to explain
the phenomenon he presents.

Thomas Dempster, born at Clisthog, Aberdeenshire, August 23. 1579, was the son of Thomas
Dempster of Muiresk and Auchterless, and os his wife Jane Leslie, sister os Leslic of Balquhain.
He was educated at 'l'urriffi sub semlai plagast* Andreae Ogslom', who was, when he himself
wrote his Historia Ecclcsiasticci. still living in the Orkneys (ii. 514). He proceeded to the
Grammar School os Aberdeen under the rector, Thomas Cargill (q. xz), and he mentions among
his schoolsellows David &Vedderburn (ii. 671), Thomas Reid [ii. 576), aud James Robertson (ii.
577) os Toulouse. The extraordinary story. which he calmly relates with a total disregard of
the national reticence, os his eldest brother james marrying the concubine os his father, the
subsequent career os the intending parricide, who burned the palace of the Bishop os Orkney.
and was torn in pieces by horses at Utrecht sor true Dcmpsterian insubordination, should be
read in the original.

He says he entered I‘embroke College. Cambridge, in his tenth year. Thence he betook
himself to France. Iri-³ wanderings now began, and a wanderer he was destined to remain to
the close. The number os Scots abroad in the Catholic and Protestant places os learning at
the time was grean and Dempster, like the sailor in Dibdin, appears to have found a friend
and a countryman in the chairs oi the leading Cominemal universities. Paris, Louvain. Rome,
Toulousc, Tournay were all in turns visited by him. and at the last place he took the degree os
MA. He was iuvited to Moutpellier by Dr. Adam Abernethy (MA. Ediu., 1594), and for a
tirne occupied a chair at NismeS. He paid a tlying visit ιο Seotland with the vague and vain
hope of recovering some of the family heritagc, but on his failure to do so he retired to Paris.
Some years later James Vl. invited him to England under a promise os making him historio—
graphcr-royal, and he there married Susanna Valeria, or Susanna NValler, the apparent cause
