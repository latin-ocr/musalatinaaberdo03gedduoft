288 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

XXVI. ΟΝ FOUR DUTCH POETS.

⁸* The Delitiw Poetarum Belgarum appeared to me, on rather a cursory inspection,
inferior to the French. Secundus outshines his successors. . . . Dominic Baudius is har-
rnonious and elegant, but with little originality or vigour. These poets are loose and negligent
in versification, ending too often a pentameter with a polysyllable, and with seeble effect ; they
have also little idea of several other common rules os Latin composition '¹ (Hallam, Litcmture.

ch. xiv. §96).

¹· Daniel Heinsius. conspicuous as Secretary to the Synod os Dort, and a Latin poet os
distinguished name. . . . Grotius was not quite so great a master os the Greek as of the Latin
language” (ibid. ch. xviii. ἐξ 12, 13).

loannes Secundus, Johann Everts, 1511-1536; born at the Hague; private Secretary to
Charles V. Died os sever at St. Arnand, near Tournay.

ARGUMENT.

Pack. others! Enough for me be the four Dutch swam, the rare glory os the
Aonian Choir. Raudius is graciouS, Secundus sweet, Grotius learned, Heinsius soft.
l5audius is Suasion 3 Venus, your kisses are Secundus ; Heinsius is Eram, Grotius is
Grace itself. Baudius is the Muse's tongue, Secundus the lips, Heinsius the eyes,
Grotius the cheelrs. Happy you! 1 view the lofty peak, and worship those who
have gained the slopes of Pindus: but you, bards from the Dutch shore, beyond all
others, equals among yourselves οι· otherwise.

XXVI. DE QUATUOR BATAVIS POETIS.

Ite alii : mihi sat Batavo de litore cygni
Quatuor, Aonii gloria rara chori.
Baudius hic est blandiloquus, suavisque Secundus,
Grotius hic doctus, Heinsius hic tener est.
5 Issaudius est Peith0: tua basia, Cypri, Secundus,
Heinsius est Erato, Grotius ipsa charis.
Baudius est lingua, et Musarum labra Secundus,
Heinsius est oculi, Grotius inde genae.
Felices! ego suspicio sublime cacumen,
10 Et veneror Pindi qui tenuere iugum z
Vos tamen aute alios, Batavo de litore, vates :
Sive pares placuit, seu minus ire pares.

5. Peitho. Πειθώ, Ρετςυῑιςὶοιη Suada, Suadela.
6. Erato, Muse os amatory poetry. Compare Leeeh's apotheosis of his models with Keats's
Ode on the I'ocls: “ Bards of l’assion aud of Mirth ”.
