8 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Tres italos Galli senos vicere. sed unuin
Vincere Scotigenam non potuere novem.

The three Frenchmen were Michael de L'Hfipital, the Chancellor; Hadrian Turnebus:
Joannes Auratus. The six ltalians were Sannazarius. mammutius, Flaminius, Vida, Nau-
gerius, and Cardinal Bembo. On the ltaliam, see Hallam's judgment in Litcrature osEurope,
chap. viii. ἐξ 30-34. This long-forgotten quarrel, which roused the Scots abroad of all religions,
politics, and ranks to unanimity, is curious as showing the European reputation achieved by
Buchanan, who, says Prof. llume Brown, did sor his country what Scott did by his poenis and
novels. One admirer os Barclay's achievement. James Balliol, wrote thar he had done a
national service, and crowned the house os Towie. or Tolly, with deathless same.

Romulus et Cossus vel non Marcellus opimis
Ornati spoliis te potiora gerunt.

Tollica perpetuo domus est celebranda canore.
Ex qua tan-1 docti prosiluere viri.

[Part. Scotorum Musa Sacrae, ii. 442]

Multis note diebus, Eglissemi!
lit annis mihi valde amate multis:
Habet me male, non pudet fateri,
scribendi cacoethes huius aevi.
5 Hoc te crimine liberum putaram,
Donec venerat in manum libellus,
Quo tu praecipuum Triariorum
Ad certamen es ausus evocare.
Sed O quot dabis omnibus, quot unis
lo Dahis Parisiis, amice! poenas:
