2 56 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Os persona! traits, besides the love of same, which we have seen him consessing, we can
infer that he was little os stature.

“ Ne me puella spernas,
Parvum videns, brevemque . . .
Ut corpore esse nanum,
ln amore me gigantem.”
-Auacrcontica‚ Lib. ii. p. 64.

Like his patron, Pembroke. he was a smoker, and (Epig. iii. p. 67) he has some frank lines
that seem to hint at his failings :—

Paetum‚ et Iacche parens, et amarae mella Cytheres‚
Tema mihi ignoti causa cibusque mali,
Daemonis aequa trias, sed non tamen acqua, valete.¹

os Autobiogmphy, xsth April, 1327, und add his Fan-well to Tobacco. On the ‘⁴ mella

“ My only books

The long poem by Lmen-Nemo: Calendis Maii.- Anno. Dom. 1617, addressed to the
lx'ing—is a mere series of quips and plays on the meaning of Nemo. lt is followed by eight
lines, playing on ‘⁸ Nem& and ‘⁸ Nihil‚'' by David Lena-naeus, but this is clearly not his brother
David, who entered King's Cnllcge only in 1620, hut the David Leech ol Mourisemille, to
whom (Epig. i. p. 19) he has lines. The poem os Nemo is illustrated by the lines os johannes
l’asserat. os the University os Paris, sent to lirricus Memmius on the Calcnds os januar-y,
which will be found cited in Johnson’s Lires nflhc Pons at the end os his lise of Rochester.
““ The strongest effort os his (Rochester's) muse is hi> poeni upon ¹ Nothing ¹. He is. not the
first who has chosen this barren topic sor the boast os his fertility. 'l'here is a poem cal'ed
¹ Nihil' in Latin by Passer-at, a poet and critic os the sixteenth century in France.'' Elsewhere
Johnson suggests whether Sir'l'honms Browne's running the Quincunx to death in The Gardcn
ns Cyrus may not be a survival os the same hunt by the older Humanists aster some topic,
never selected before by Greek and Latin writers. on which to display their too frequently
ini-<applied ingenuity.

It will be seen srorn what has been said that Leech is superior to Arthur Johnston in
fertility and in range, though he is inferior to that master of elegiae verse in finish and the
purely classica! style. Leech was clearly precociouz. and his verse is in many ways modern,
while there is an archaic tinge in Johnston. But he is unquestionably a dangerous rival to
that poet. who so long has reigned in the north without opposition, and has been the accepted
master of verse. Leech's. Latin prose is not equal to his verse: it is flowery, affected, and
artificial. In his Eslogac Nauticae V.‚ to Echo, he has a laborious eclogue with echo-lines,
aster the fancy of the period. His friend, Sir William Alexander, Earl os Stirling. has this

frigid conceit in An Eccho :—
