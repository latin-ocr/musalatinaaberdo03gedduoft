JOHN JOHNSTON. 109

XXVI.
Thomas Smeton. Prof. of 'I'heology‚ Glasgow. died 1)‹.·c. 13, 1583.
The man of greatest and bitterest experienee consessus he has seen nothing ³
satlder than these times. His grief is that he hitherto suri-ivos the futes.

(2·)
Far travelled and greatly learned, his chief knowledge was¹ to know salvation in
Christ and to teach the riches os God.

XXVII.

William Christison. minister os Dundee, died Oct. 16, ¹50¹]-

XVhen my country lest me and hopes failed, l had to secl< another. Denmark
took me, and there I learned its tongue. 'I'hen lssergen saw mc, Duridee gives me a
call. I (lid my best while old age came on. May this famous city have many
teachers; it will not err in calling me father.

XXVIII.
Audi-ew hay, minister of Renfrcw‚ died Oct. 2, 1593.

Never was there a purer soul. Glasgow affords him a field of action, and he in
turn adorns Glasgow.

(2·)

How finely do Glasgow and Hay agree! They have one love, one sorrow.
With one mind they bewail the departure of Melville, the death of Smeton. They
join in grief: Glasgow breaks into tears, Hay falls.

XXIX.
John Davidson, minister of Prestonpans‚ died Aug. 30, 1604, aged 62.

All things must bow to God. Why complain we of the rights ot* Death. Death
that is a gain to the good, a terror to the bad ? Davidson, that bright example of
our age, is gone. He gives his goods to the poor. builds schools and churches‚ and

yet in giving has everything in abundance. Others have enough ado in leaving
their children rieh; Christ, the giver of all, was his all.

XXX.
David Black, died of apoplexy‚ Jan. 5, 1603.

Is that eloquent tongue which poured forth the praises of God silent? After
so many griefs do you pass away? Grief prevents me from speaking more.

(2.)

XVhen Black enters Heaven‚ the earth was covered with white snow, Nothing
was whiter than his soul.

(3·)
After many cares and labours Black passes to Heaven. There was no pause:
such a passage was no death. What was night to others was day to him.
