374 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Zethes drave afar the foul Harpies, so, great king, have you subdued these monsters
by the acuteness of your happy wit.

Night and day you turn over old primitive oracles, betaking you to the days of
old. You bring back the scattered folds to the primitive teaching and attempt to
unite them, following ever in the footprints of Christ and the holy Fathers. If you
ean but unite them l Not such the boast of Augustus on closing the temple ofJanus,
nor the honour of Constantine, as would this service add to your virtue and renown.
On, great king, nor let hostile plans hinder your holy daring. 1fGod is for you, who
can be against you ? Like wax in the sire, like the broken potsherd. shall He crush
all your foes. If out of Narcissus-like love foreign princes reject these peaceful over-
tures, still⁷ O King, go on to unite them. Like a tree outlasting many generations of
men, the band of Christ will plant its firm foundation. Look at the whole fabric of
the world—a union of parent Nature. Such is Nature's harmony. Part that, and
Chaos forthwith returns. We have one seat surrounded by the moaning main, one
foe, one speech, one God, and one king.

What of this attendant train, rulers of the Saxon lands, secking Seotland and ex-
tending to you the olive branch os peace in a hand that of old brandished the spear?
Men turn again to the age of gold. Let it be our pleasure to fleet the day and night
in joy. 'Tis a delight to seour the lofty heights, or where the sierce boar hides his
cubs. 'so rousc the wild beasts Venus leaves Paphos and her chosen idalium and
Cythera. The Fauns, the Dryads, and Delia girt with her maiden bands,j0in the
ehase. With this at an end you survey your native land. Turn where you will your
steps or eyes, every direction shows renowned memorials. Feed your eyes, the fleet-
ing years press on apace and white hairs sap the old man's lise, unless, as Iolaus re-
turned to his early years, Hebe grants you the same boon in your native air, and the
fresh thread of your life begins again on the distaff of the Fates. The gardens and
the meads smile, the mild sky invites you. The shrines through all the cities re-
double their gladsome eries, while young and old bes-iege heaven with their prayerS,
destined another day to tell at the festal board of your route. Nay, if the little field
of Molorchus pleasecl great Hercules; if your home. Philemon, found favour with
Jove himself, may not your native Scotland pleasc you Ρ You are our crowning joy,
our towns are protected not by towers but by our own right hands. Rome that curbed
the Parthian was forced to check their force by rampart and trench. Free Seotland
bends to your yol<e⁷ so that by rosy dawn or darksome night every house makes this
its prayer: “'l‘o Thee, Most Mighty Faffier, with one voice we pay our grateful
thanks. All is Thy gift. Thou <lost favour and increase our stote, since Thou dost
preserve him with whom is bound up the welfare of the state. May these degenerate
days never gain the upper hand of this, and safe and sound may he return and pass a
long course of days, never forgetful of his dear native land.''
