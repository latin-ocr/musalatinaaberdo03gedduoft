170 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Moe. First, shepherd, lie under the cool shade, it resreshes the weary way-
farer, the shady grove oft delights the rural gods. Diana, weary with the chase,
seeks the cool shade.

Cor. Tell me, then, now we have entered the quivering shade, I shall listen
attentively.

Moe. Our song begins from Jove, who rules all. The earth surrounded by the
sea, and the deep sea he restores again by his almighty power. And now what
pleasing victim from the sheept'olds of Scotland shall redden thy altar, ruler os the
gods? A burnt offering must be his, let us pay his altars their due rites. O Daphnis,
the shepherd’s joy, Jove's mighty power has restored you to the woods. Daphnis,
your country’s boast, the gods’ peculiar care, after a foreign forest hid you in its
shade, Apollo, the Fauns, the gods of wood and field, the sportive Satyrs, Diana, the
Dryades, the goddesses os the dell quitted the woodlands. The band of the Druids,
too, who tend the rites of the Thunderer, flecl banished from these shores. But after
Jove's right hand 1135 restored you, Daphnis, Apollo and the woodland powers from
all hands seek again the leafy plain, and chant afresh the song of triumph through
Scotland. You, O omisis, all the powers of our woods greet joyously, and the whole
world congratulates you. Like the aspect of heaven when darkened, when a wild
tempest flms, and a cloud 11115 through the air, when the earth trembles, the sea
swells, and everything threatens death to rnan and beast; but soon as Phoebus in
his brightness leaves the eastern wave, and arrays the world in his bcams, the earth
shines, the sca is hushed‚ and the welkin calm. Just so does your absence affect
the face os things. Alack! 3 terrible tempest raged through the Caledonian fields,
the flock roamcd through the slippery grass, and no trusty Daphnis led it to the
river beds. 11111 a joyful aspect of affairs greets you on your return. Shepherds
crowned with garlands rejoicc and sing, the sheep crops the dewy grass, the lamb
sports in the quix'ering shadc with its dam, the goat leaps on the lofty rock. Nature
rejoices. the former calm sky returns, and the ocean sinks to rest.

Cor. W'ondrous is your tale. 1 envy not the artful notes of your pipe, but
rather congratulate you on Jove‘s doing such great deeds for Scotland's woods.
Farewell, and henceforth may the fates grant you a happy old age.

Moe. Farewell in turn, and may no evil eye blight your tendes lambs, but may
your flock satten afield. Come, happy flock, come goats, you have had your fill.

Corydon, Moeris.

Lumina vix medio diffuderat aurea caelo
Phoebus, cum salices inter consedit opacas
Moeris odoriferi vernante in gramine campi,
Tempora floridulis vinctus pastoria sertis.

5 Iam non in fragili pendebat fistula ramo
Moesta, nec incomptis stridebat rauca querelis;
