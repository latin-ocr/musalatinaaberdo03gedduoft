WILLIAM BARCLAY. 15

ΑκῡυΜι-ῑΝ-τ.

O Devana, revived Athens; Glory of the North. Devana. the nont< os Britain
κ and chosen spot of retirement with Apollo and his choir before a thousand Delphis.
Ι love you not for your health-giving waters which all the world drinks on my re-
commendation, not sor your rich streams, through which Scotland abounds in
French gold, when Don, kindly father, sends yearly over sea his ‹leniaens and
brings back hcaps of Louis d'ors. Not for this I love you. but sor your citizens·
civility and pleasant ways Among whom four shinc pre—eminent for their balanced
learning· and blithc manners. He holds the first place, not only in the city but
almost in the kingdom, either by his honeyed sacred cloqucnec, or as he calinly
watches peoplc in consultation‚ or unites them in concord, or censuros evil thoughts,
words, deeds, as an enemy and yet a friend, true bishop in speech and life. 'she
second is his cqual in learning and way of life, inferior to hirn in rank and station.
Both doubly draw and are drawn to heaven where their thoughts rest, and these
two excel all other preachers as much as they yield in turn to one another. Third
comes the Alpha and Omega of scholars, to my way of thinking. Surpassing hosts
of other men, through whom this northern republic of elegant letters is propped, to
whom Phoebus Apollo owes as many a garland as he has led youths to the heights os
Pindus. Is the fourth lends a hand, I shall think that my distant follow-country-
men will shortly send to you Paris, O world's eye, learning again. For their sake
shall 1 love you, O Devana, revived Athens, Glory of the North, whether noble
Belgium shall hold me, or friendly Germany, or Romc’s haughty walls, or the hospit-
able France, or blessed England, the country of aingem, where fate calls me and Ι
pray may set me, and grant me to bear less keenly the keen longing 1 scel for you.

VI. APOBATERION.
[Sylvac Tres, Edinburgh, 1619.]

O Devana, resuscitatae Athenae,
Septem gloria civitas trionum:
O Devana, Britanniae recessus
Et secessus Apollinis, chorique

5 Pulchri Apollinis, ante mille Delphos,
Non te propter aquas amo salubres,
Quas per me bibit universus orbis;

Sic Aberdoni Ptolem.

intelligo Callirhoen

Non propter fluviOs opum feraces, sontem quem
Ob quos Scotia Gallo abundat aui-0, scripto laudavi.
10 Quando Dona, bonus pater, quotannis

Mittit per maria incolas suOS, et
Refert in patriam aureorum acervos,
Non ob haec amo te, sed ob virorum
