WILLIAM BARCLAY. 5

Ι. ΤΟ ΑΝ ITINERANT QUACK.

An attack by Barclay, as ⁴ ΜΓ of Art and Doctor os Physicke: on the proscssional inter-
loper. spaldings, ii. 292. describes under Nov. 1643, “ane Ductor l'ont. who had some stage
playis, quhilk drew the people to behold the sport; sync vpon the stage sold certain balmes,
oyllis, and vther phisicall oyntments, quhairos he maid gryte gzine. 'l'lmireftcr he went north
to vther burrowis and did the 1ike.'¹ Barclay in his Ncprntlics (spald. Club Miscell. i. ²⁶7) ιχ
severe on ‘¹ the galls os dogs and superstitious characters vsed by a number os ignorant dcboshed
Vagabondes and Montebanckes·‘. The catalogue of the curious Kirkwall Bibliotheck (erarem,
at Kirkwall. 1897, p. 31) has ‘William Reid. Advertisemcnt of Medicincs to he Sold from :x
Stage at lidinburgh. 4to'. This is doubtless the prospectus os the famous Reid. ⁴¹ The king's
(James VII.) tage sor making converts was driven to such a height by his obsequious minimest,
that an ignorant negro, the Servant or slave osone Reid, ιι ηιιιιιιιίεὺαηΙε, was publickly baptiscd

ΑκῦυΜΕΝτ.

Worst of roguCS, you deserve no hendecasyllabics but trenchant iambi. Your
stall stinks with rotten warQS, and yokels buy colocynth andffldcath. You don't
drink winc3 what of that? Our home-brewed makes people more drunk. You
soal< in all the taverns, you whose whole stock is valued at a bawbcc l You claim the
name of surgeon, but (lo not venture on opening a vein, a Galen in the eyes of your
drunken cronies. O my deas native place, 'twixt Dee and Don, let the impostor
drink the poison hc himself brews! If a town's officer has gone to the sharlcs
below, let him learn to handcuff the fellow. To free his hands, l will gladly send
him stinging and hanging lines.

I. IN VAPPAM CIRCULATOREM.
[Del. Poet. Scot. i. 139, 140]

Vappa pessime, vappa pessimorum,
Nullos hendecasyllabos mereris
Manes melliflui pios Catulli:
Sed merere celerrimos iambos,
5 Acria Archilochi venena linguae.
Abundat tua toxico catasta,
Foetet materie officina putri
Quam Batavia misit exoletam
Ante annos aliquot tibi ut recentem.
[ο Hinc miselli opera tua coloni
Emunt et colocynthidem atque mortem.
