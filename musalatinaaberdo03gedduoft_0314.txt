264 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

IX. TO WALTER DONALDSON, POET LAUREATE, PRIN-
CIPAL OF THE COLLEGE OF ROCHELLE.

Α hals humorous, half pathetic address by Leech to Walter Donaldson, regretting his own
profitless devotion to the Muses. It is in the tone of Burns in the Vision. finding that

‘⁴ Half mad, hals sed, half sarkit,
Is a' th' amount '‘.

He threatens in a way to betake himself to philosophica! studies or even to theology‚ and the
tone is so often adopted that we cannot doubt it reflects more than a passing mood in the
writer's mind.

Walter Donaldson was one of the many Aberdonian Scots Abroad, who garrisoned the
Chairs in the six Protestant French colleges of Montauban, Saumur, Nisrnes. Montpellier, Die
and Sedan, besides many other subordinate scats of learning, such as Pau, Orthe& and Lescar.
Born in Aberdeen about 1575, a graduate either of King‘s or of Marischal College, he becamea
Doctor os Laws, possibly os Heidelberg. His descent is given by 31⁴Crie (Mclvinc, p. 321)
from the MS. of his son Alexander, Doctor os Medicine, dated Edinb. Nov. 15, 1642:

donia—suit filius legitimus Alexandri Donaldson, armigeri (ex nobilissima et antiquissima
familia Donaldorum in regno nostro Scotia oriund.) et Elizabethae Lamb quae suit filia legitima

ARGUMENT.

'l'rue wisdom and srccdom from all cares consists in being able at last to quit
the Muses. Haplcss, Walter, is he who under their intoxication has too deeply
drunk attho Aonian springs. Hapless he who stretches his listless length in the
grass os Claros ancl constantly strikes the lyre. O that any day. quitting afar that
fount, were rather to see me an exile on some foreign strand! 'l‘hen would I
venture on the study of natural philosophy or of divinsty, on the study of what
beneftts my country and mysels, and how a man ought now to live. Yet amI
not ashamed of having wooed the Muses and Apollo, but Ι am disgustcd at the loss
of my time and trouble. A new anxiety now aggravares my sadness, for without
food and drink what is there sor the Muse to sing? Let the man drink deep of
the Muse‘s cup that wishes to be considered by the Court a fool, to be the laughing
stock ot⁴ a learned king, to be hated by the mob unless he has a warlike frenzy on

liim.¹ wretched in fortune and mad.
