MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

What grief awoke around our Patriek's bierl
The Sehool, the Church, the Court, all felt the blow.
With her bright eyes that showed the consciens tear
And covered head wept Pallas, bending low ;
While e'en far distant Thule, too, would show
Her grief; hoarse Tweed bewailed him, and the Clyde
Through all his winding bays moaned loudly, Tay
Rolled from the Grampian peaks the swirling tide,
And backward to his source the Don was seen to glide.

The Dee to Ocean bore the groaning wave,

While wc, as was his right, fling many a rose
And llowers of varied huc upon his grave.

But, as great l'atriek fell who wrought our woeS‚
So from that golden constellation rose

The band that long the (leep-adrniring North
Beheld with awe, nor (lid the sire‘s repose

Deny a son whose name should body forth
Aneestral learning, if here aught abide of worth.

Thon Charles the Fiat, by his high court's decree,
Restored all rents and moneys‚ that before
Had appertainesl unto the bishop's sec,
To us and to our college as os yore,
In pity of the Muses that had sore
Been by the hand os sacrilege profane
Despoiled, and so we turned to building more.
Gifts all restored, when charles the son again
Enjoy'd his own, while we draw thence but little gain.

No other gift was ours until a name
In peace and war renown'd behold our woe,
The Star of Orange; pious Anne then came,
And Royal Georgo, that we might not forego
All hope nor haplcss hunger lay us low.
Some private aid we had—'twere long for all
'so find their places here—but in the glow
And wine-cup's festal revel be the call
For Buchan's name that raised afresh for us our Halll

Meet also ’tis that here we name with pride
The givcrs to our Library: no age,

Scougally can thee and thine forget3 the tide
O'erflows the limit os our scanty page,
