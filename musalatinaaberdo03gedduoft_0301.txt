Earl os Dunfermlinc‚ Thomas Hamilton, Harl of Melrose, and others. His lise-long intimacy
with Sir John Scot os Scotstarvet and with Drummond ol* Hawthornden is apparent in :111 his
wmks, and can be sully seen in the Scot-Leech correspondence in the Advocates' Library,
Edinburgh, and in the Drummond papers preserved in the Edinburgh University Library.
The dedication of the puzzling 1620 volume to Prince Charles is also to be noticed.

'l'hat there was some cause that blighted his prospecte. or his hopes from patrous, that he
had been in jail, that he was unfortunate, is clear from the distinct allusions in his poems and
letters. There were rumours in circulatim, he was the subject of malevolent hatred and
detraction, but the precise nature of the charges it is now, os course, impossible to state or even
guess. To James Hay, Viscount Doncaster, one os the Royal upstart Scottish savouritcS,
Epig- iv. 81, he says :—

⁴* Me cerne, tolle, me tuere, iam nimis
Inopem, iacentem, proditum male a malis,
Tot sumptibus, sorte invida, calumniis.‘¹

He appeals also to Thomas Goddaeus‚chap1ain to Abbot, the Archbishop ot' Canterbury‚ to
speak to his master on his behals (Epig. iii. 51)—

¹‘ Goddaee. solum flecte Praesulem tuum.
Non iam ira potuit ista defervescere?
Nonne illa primos spiritus remittere?
Si dente crimen sit laesisse noxio,
Lusisse crimen dente non innoxio est.
Si laesimus, non solvimus poenas leves.
Si lusimus, sat solvimus poenas graves.''

He has no patron (Epig. iii. 68) and must therefore be his own :—-

Dura meos numeros sequitur Fortuna, patronum
Quaeritat at nullum nostra Thalia videa.

Ergo, mihi placeam satis est. Sic ipse poeta,
Ipse mihi lector, ipse patronus ero.''

This, and the whole of the selected extracts, would be sufficient to shew his pecuniary distress.

That he was unpractical is clear, and his rather belated ambition. to pose as the writer os
a Latin epic or as an erotic poet in the style of the Latin elegiae composers, may have added
to his trouble. Scot of Scotstarvet, his practica! friend, advises him to turn to law, and hints
that there was more money in justinian than in the poetic style os Philetas, Callimachus,
Mimnermus, Sappho, and the Teian muse os Anacreon. The question of the Latin Epic is
fully dealt with in the introductions. That the tone of his Pantheo and the Anacreontisa is
free, and quite unduly so, is apparent, but on this curious question there is still much confusion
in the mind ol* the ordinary reader. These erotic verses were purely imaginary, and were
simply a variation of the Roman elegiae poets, unduly prolonged srom the earlier day of the
Humanists. The subject is of some importance, and merits here some explanation. The
poems were as purely fictitious and destitute os all actual basis as are many of the Odes of
Horace, though the older commentators spent much time and vain research on the supposed
loves of that writer, and even yet Burns' editors are not quite free from signs of that lues of the
biographer. These verses by the Humanists were simply an imitation of Catullus, Ovid,
Tibullus, Propertiusv and Martial, composed to show their skill in vamping a theme and run-
