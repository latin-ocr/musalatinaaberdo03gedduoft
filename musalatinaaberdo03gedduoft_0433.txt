Muneris usque tui totum est. 'ru fautor et auctor,
Quippe illurn incolumem praestaS, quo sospite sospes
Publica res, labente labat, tractura ruinam

310 Cum sonitu ingentem. Quae ne, pater optime, vincant
Haec retro in peius vergentia saecla, tuorum
Da pater O votis. Atque ut virtutis imago
Et regum exemplar vivuin rex omine dextro
Hactenus hoc molitus iter, sic salvus et usque

tions: 1. 53, aras (Del.); l. 142, Vcl. (ΜηεεςΙ 11'cl.): l. 185, profecti (Muses' Wcl.): 1. 233,
flcclcs (Muses Wcl.); l. 257: Huc. (Muscs' ΨΑ), After l. 159 the Muscs' Wclcamc version has

Reddita bello, Anglus cujus pars magna suturae
Grata rudimenta et primordia pacis amica
Belliger exhibuit) solido fundamine sedes
Hic positura suas, si te tria regna sub un0,'' etc.
