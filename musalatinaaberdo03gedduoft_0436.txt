IV. THE L’ENVOY OF THE GRACES OF ABERDEEN.

During the royal visit, the Bur-gh of Aberdeen was kept in expectation.

‘¹ Having repaired to Edinburgh, the magistrates of Aberdeen received early intelligence
by letter, from the lords of the privy council, os his intentions to remain sor some time in Scot-
land sor his “sport and game.” They were, at the same time, advised that he proposed to
make a progress to the north, with his attendants, in the course of which he intended ‘¹ to pay
a visit to the chief boroughs os the kingdom, particularly Aberdeen: which, being among the
best, his Majesty was so much the more anxious that all things be so orderly provided there,
that there appear no marks os incivility, or token of penury or scant; and, therefore, recom-
mending that lodgings be prepared in the most handsome, civil and courtly manner, with good
bedding, well-washed and well-smelled napperie, clear and clean vessels. of sufficient large·
neSS‚ plenty of provisions and vivers3 the streets to be kept clear of beggam and middings.'' ¹

This minutely detailed dispatch being communicated to the citizens, assembled in their
head court, they most cheersully promised the strictest observance of the injunctions which
had been given, and arranged matters accordingly. However well prepared they may have
been for the reception os the royal party, they were extremely mortified by the disappointment
which they met with, in not being honoured with a visit from his Majesty on this ocoesion.
The king, although he was in the neighbourhood, at a hunting excursion, did not gratify the
citizens with his presence: but many of his attendants repaired to the town, where they were
received with the greatest marks of attention and respect. Here they remained for some time,
and were hospitably entertained, at the expense os the community. The magistrates con-
ferred upon them tlie freedom of the town; and that nothing might be deficient in the way os
respect to the king, David Wedderburn, rector os the Grammar school, was requested by the
magistrates to compose a poetical address, in Latin, complimental os his Majesty for honour-
ing the kingdom with his presence at this time, and which appears to have been graciously
received. For this work Mr. wedderburn ¹¹ received a present of fifty marks in money from the
treasurer '' (Kennedy's Annals asAbcrdccn. i. pp. 135, 130).

For the list os those made burgesses of guild on this occasion, see p. 136 n. Only the
name os the last, Archie Armstrong, the King's Fool, has survived.

ARGUMENT.

“Stay, stay your wheels and glowing car. Is the land you leave that of the
soc? '¹ The goddesses turn to gaze. Meanwhile the Graces, the honoured stock os
Eurynome, run up. “ so then you g0, perfect flower of kings. Silent are the birds
that charmed the air while you the king were here, the burns ccase to bieker.
'she Nymphs pine away, and call upon your name with the coming and the parting
day. The sun that attends you on your arrival attends your departure, so you may
see the heavenly orbs are at your call. The Cities late so joyous, now, as joys are
never lasting, at the change and the withdrawal of the Muses cannot free themselves
from grief.'' More she could not say. Aglaia takes up the tale. “ Deeply in their
hearts have the cities of Scotland felt this blow. Since you attended by the Muses
