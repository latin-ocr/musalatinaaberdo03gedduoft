ABERDEEN. ⁷

by Leech whether the tone os the writer is complimentary or gently ironical. The attitude
of his brother, David Leech, can be seen froin the Allcgoria in the 1635 Funcmls, which is
clearly unfriendly. The College affairs (A berei. Qnaterccnt. studies, pp. 36-7), had reached a
finnncial and educationnl crisis, and Rait's long reign seems to have coincided with the nadir
of the fortunes of the College. Hence he bears the burden of ¹¹ lamentable heathenism and
sic lowsness as is horrible to record,'' and we cannot decide whether the charge reflects ineffi-
cieney, downright obstruction. or both ’“. lt is fair to remember that the Funcmls represent

the manifesto os a party.

Ruit, fifth Principal from historian Boece, Rait, the great glory os the school of
Elphinstone‚ you who restore our annual rents and see to the skilful rcbuilding of
our ruinctl pile. happy be your years and your old age, and so may the remainder of
your life pass gently. Stcal a little from your assiduous toil, give yourself some
relaxatum to bestow on my Muse; while it can bid you hail and sarcwell. Choose

which: any way, farcwell.

Ill. DAVIDI RHAETO, COLLEGII REGII ABREDONENSIS
MODERATORI.

Rhoete, qui ab historico moderaris quinte Boethio,
Magna Elphinstoniae gloria, Rhaete, scholae,
Annua restituis qui pensa, et diruta rursus
Artifici curas aedificanda manu,
5 Sic tibi felices anni facilisque senectus
Sic reliquum vitae molle eat omne tuae.
Paulum agedum assiduo temet furare labori,
Otia da Musis quantulacunque meis,
Dicere dum salvere tibi possintque valere.
10 Elige utrum capias, sed modo, Rham, vale.
