111. APPEAL To THE MOST Aucus'r ΑΝΙ) MIGHTY Kisa
JAMES vi.

A Divinatio in Roman law was an exainination to determine which os several accusem
was most qualissed to conduct a case sor the prosecution. lt is the title os Cicero's speech
against Caecilius, Divinatio in ccci-ilium. Apparently here Dempster, who was ,1.-ίὶ4 (Jnris
Consanus) and a well-read civrlian, uses it generally for an appeal to the King to decide between
him and his accusers, who by their malevolence had blasted the wanderer's hopes os preser-
ment. That there would be plenty os reasons abroad is clear. His pugnacious and ungovern-
able temper, his boundless vanity and religious views were all against him in a (jourt where
the theological atmosphere was so pervasive. Andre du saussay, Bishop of 'l'ulle (1)‹· Scrip-
toribus Eccleshzsficis, 1684, p. 82). his old pupil, describes Dcmpster as a man ‘pugnaci animo
et contentioso ac instabili, quo genio ductus plerumque domicilia mutavit? By another friend
he is described as *moribus ferox, apertus et simulandi nescius, acceptaeque injuriae tenax)
and the characteristic features of the man are writ large in all his works. He himself ascribes
the enmity that pursued him to the representations os Cowper, Bishop of Galloway, whom ht:
defeated, he says, in a theological dispute at Perth of three days‘ duramen, and in lingland tu
the action of Bishop Montague of Bath and Wells. A Catholie like Dempster was likely to be
an object os strong hostility to the clergy, unless he were one os the unstable type like Mare
Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop os Spalatro (Ilallam, Lite-ratum· qs Iinrofiv, ch. xviii. §21
and note).

It has been argued that Dempster could scarcely venture on a false pedigree and the
detailed evidence of lines ,ιο-42, in a poem to the King. It may be equally true that, finding,y
the door closed on his hopes from royalty, he effects a retreat with drums beating and colours
flying, while his concluding lines are full os dignity, and redolent os the travelled and wander-
ing humanist‚ or ‘ Scot Abroad '. In fact, Dempster’s type was a familiar one, and he recalls
the life of Francesco Filelfo, living only a century too late. See Villari's Maeliiuvclli (Fisher
Unwin, London), pp. 110-14.

ARGUMENT.

So, then, do ἶ stir the stars with my plaint, and the gods that will not hear,
while the Thunderer of my country sor some time bas not listened to my praycrs?
For six months have Ι been kept from my studies and mocked with empty hopes.
Why has the royal goodwill so suddenly changed, and his grace left me almost
alone ? VVas the hour of my birth unpropitious, and did the stass 1001< unkindly on
me? Mars, Mercury, Jupiter himself with his own royal voice promised my birth
would be dcar to Kings. Or lies the offence with song, and is this your fault,
Muses, who have not been asbamed to blend falsehood in your lines? But our page
had a true encomium of the King⁷ and bore names that admit os no salse coloni-ing,
which late generations shall praise and envy vainly scelus to depressa Or is the
Prince’s mind turned from the Muses, andis that band of no account which shines by
honouring Apollo Ρ Has virtue no reward, and are asts despised, which before were
wont to raise their head under his protection ? 01· has our ignoble origin and de-
spised birth displeased him, as unfit for the cares of a King? But the torch of my
race shines most brightly, I raise my head proud os my ancestral distinction, and
