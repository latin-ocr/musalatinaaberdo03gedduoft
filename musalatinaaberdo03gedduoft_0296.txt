ARGUMENT.

Do you so delight, Anderson, mindful of your old teacher, to bring balrn to my
bootis, and not only to succour the prisoner with prayers, but also to offer the means
os freedom and restoration to my true sels. Has your letter, written with the hand
of an angel and brought over glassy seas, brought such joy to me? Ο piety and
memorable pledge of a loyal mind, meeting my eyes day and night! Great was it for
you to have only been able: greater for you to have wished it, sor me to have
deservcd it. Away, ungratcful phantoms! With you Faith, Piety, and Duty become
revealed. Enough for me that Joseph is restored to Jacob in his old age. With the
son safe, the father revives. l will go, l will see the solace os my age. Use your
means as you please; iny setters are broken by the force of your love.

Another Io thc Same.

¹· ln what consists honour?'’ had been the question proposed under my presi-
dency of old by your wit. At the time when 1 was your instructor in Moral
Philosophy 1 perhaps made a mistake. ⁸· Honour resides with the person honouring‚’'
I said. Now, with an alteration os circumstances, let all honour more truly reside
in the person honoured. In the laurel given you by my right hand, the pitch of
honour restcd with you alone, not nie. The herald pmclaims, but does not grant
the honours of the king. Be yours the glory, as honoured; be mine the glory,
through your merits in honouring.

Sicne memor prisci iuvat (Andersone) Magistri
Mollia compedibus balsama ferre meis,
Nec tantum effusis vincto succurrere votis
Et mecum, parili sub cruce, triste pati,
5 Sed gazas offerre pares, ut carcere duro
Sic redimar, Genio restituatque meo?
Sic mihi tandundem vitreas transmissa per undas
Edidit angelica litera scripta manu?
O pietas! gratique animi memorabile pignus
10 Obversans oculis nocte dieque ineis!
Grande tibi, tanturn potuisse; et grandius inde
Ut voluisse tibi, sic meruisse mihi.
Ingratae procul ite umbrae! te vindice, nobis
Firma Fides, Pietas, Obsequiumque, patent:
