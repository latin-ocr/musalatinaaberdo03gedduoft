xxiv INTRODUCTION.

Quis tamen ὁ diuum superas reuocauit in oras '2
Quistulit afflictae spemque, manumque Deae?
Certe illam modo harbaries inuisa premebam
Et prope fatali condiderat tumulo:
Membra eluxatam : foedatam turpiter ora,
Et nullsi similem denique parte sibi.
Cui desperatae licuit promittere w'res?
Vulnera quil poterant tanta coire manu?
Muneris, Anderwne, tui hoc totum, ilicet vnus.
Tu Phoebus lat-sue, l'hillyridesque Deae.
Saepe homini poterant (linique hominesque salutem.
Te prior hanc ipsis sed dare nemo Diis.”—
[sm-ll ‚⁴ Alma( l’rt'aretr, Eflsc. ii. 37, 38,

These items throw fresh light on one of the greatest mathema-
ticians of his time, who is regarded by De Morgan as “an
excellent geometer Liztle has been hitherto known about him
except his residence in l'aris and the (lates of his works. There
is no reason to doubt Dempster's statement, which is quite prob-
able. Anderson was the cousin ‹›f the brothers David Anderson
of Finzeauch -Ν Davie do a' things ''—a11d John Anderson,
house-palmer in Edinburgh, to whom his nephew, George Jame-
sone the artist, was bound apprentice¹ before starting‚ like “John
Philip of Spain ” in similar circumstances as a portrait painter.
lt was from the Anderson branch that the remarkable mathemati-
cal ability of the Gregory family, through so many descents, was
inherit‹¹.d; David Anderson's daughter married the Rev. John
Gregory of Drumoak.

James Cheyne of Arnage‚ MA. of King's CoHege, studied at
Paris and Douai, and died at 'l'ournay in 1603 as Canon of
Tournay. He enjoyed a great reputation. The Innes fly-leaf
referred to above preserves fresh items in his record, and the
career of others.
