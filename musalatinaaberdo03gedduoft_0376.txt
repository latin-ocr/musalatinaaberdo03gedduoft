326 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

from the discipline of the Assembly and seceding to Independency. Row at least maintained
the reputation of the University as a teacher and as a disciplinarian. In June, 1658, there was
erected in the north-east corner of the quadrangle the building of six [lats and οἱ twenty-four
chambers‚ which, from the help given by the Officers os the Commonwealth in the north, has
corne in recent years to be styled “Cromwell's Tower⁷' (Walker, Historical Notcs, p. 29).
¹¹ Nor in his care sor the fabric did Row neglect the interna] upbuilding of his college. He
was a mastersul man; not altogether ungenial, for he encouraged sootball, and did not frown
on the ⁴ wyn, tobaeco and pypes ’ of the Regents; but he was a most strict disciplinarian os
the Puritan type, and withal an alert educationist——his students becoming famous for their
disputations in Philosophy, not in the vernacular, but iu Greek, Latin, French or Hebrew.
For nine years, from 1652 to 1661, John Row laboured and taught. And then the sate os Dr.
Guild overtook him. At the restoration os the monarchy, Now was dismissed'* (Abcrd.
Quatcrccnt. Stmlies, p. 46).

Row's Euclzaristm lssasilikc, with its altered opinions and attack on Cromwell as Trux
vilis vermis ct alter ΑΙιαὺιις, was issued on June 14, 1660. But the l'hilistines were upon
him, and his political time-serving sailed to save him. He anticipated deposition by resigna-
tion on Aug. 1, 1661. lle fell back on his old profession and opened a private school in New
Aherdeen. Orein, who inherited the antipathies ol Spalding with a virulence of his own,
says Row's books were taken from the College to the eross and burned by the hangrnan,
adding that he lived ‘⁵ by keeping the said school, and sor the most part by charity''. He
retired to the manse of his son-in-law, Mr. John Merces, at Kinellar. where he died of palsy
in 1672. in the seventy-sourth year os his age.

Grads. p. 26).

Row’s effort in verse is conspicuously inferior to the similar productions by the wedder-
burns and others os an older day. At times he is incoherent and obseure; his Hebrew,
doubtless, was better than his Latin, which marks the decline from the classic period os the
Raban l'ress. lt is here printed as a historieal curiosity, without an argument. The political
apostasy os the old Roundhead is painful, and his breathless attempt to ‘· rush’' his book
through the press on the eve os the Restoration has only served to land his Latinity in con-
fusion and his memory in disgrace. For Cromwell's generous attitude to the University,
attested under Row's own signatum, see the recent evidence in Aberd. Quatcr. Studics,
p. 44 n.

'l'hat Row's hand was forced by the condition of all‘airs in Aberdeen is clear. The follow-
ing bibliography for the period speaks sor itselsz—
