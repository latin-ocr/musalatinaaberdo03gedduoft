50 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Nomen et aeternum plaudenti fama volatu

Te serat in populos longinqua gente repostos
145 Munificae regem dextrae, te pacis amantem

Armati timeant, et quae per lustra corona

Ornavit bis dena comas, totidem impleat annos

Felici stadio. Sic plena aetate verendus

Civium amor, terrorque hostiS‚ et gloria saecli,
150 Debita magnanimo tradas diademata nato,

Et capias dignam caelesti sede quietem.

O faxint superi poscat non irrita vates !

11-13. On this topic the writers in the Deliciae and the sulsorne Pancgyrioe of the period
exhaust every hyperbole and run the gamut os every classical allusion. John Scot (Dcl. Poct.
δῖοί. ii. 47⁰) is rather novel and poetical in his praise 2-—

¹· Quamvis veniant in carmina Phoebus,
Atque novem coetu Pallas comitata sororum,
Castalis ipsa licet sicco pede murmuret unda,
Non tibi digna tua reddentur carmina laude.''

26, lilia. The lilies were the emblem os the Virgin Mary.

27. Daphnide. The laurclv with allusion to Daphne. But there is no such Latin word.
In Greek δάφνις is laurel-berry; nor by the proper name can Dempstcr allude to the pastoral
Daphnis.

32. The inevitable reference to Ferguss and the long line of James' one hundred and seven
predecessor53 and to the anco—Scottish alliance.

50. Rather a diplomanc allusion to the ramparts of Agricola, Hadrian, Antonine, and
Severus.

5⁴. One of the ver),- few allusious in the Dclitim· and writers os the period to James'
mother. As the Augustam laureates thrcw Julius Caesar discreetly in the shade, so the pane·
gyrists of james avoided reference to Mary. To the embolis: Dempster she is “ sanctissima!
John Johnston (lm. Poet. δῖοί. ἰ. 679) has four lines on her; Andrew Melville (i. 112) is
gem-rous ; Archbishop Patrick Adamson (Epigrammata, p. 08, 1619) has four vague lines.

77. peregrino. The Macedoniam.

104. The usual flattery of James' poetical fliglns in his chanw, celebrating the victory
of Don John os nustria (see VVedderburn's Aberdmzia Atrum, 158).

1 io. The ¹ Casket Copy' os Homer, corrected by Aristone.

11¹. The connection os Panaetius and Pompey seems lost.

113. Pelopidas, sreeing Thebes from the tyranny os Sparta.

τιὸ. The murder os Clitus, and deaths of Parmenio and Philotas. “ Alexander, stained
with household blood and wine '¹ (Byron, Childc Harom, iv. cxi.).

121. calvitio. ⁴¹ Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head '' (Childc Har-old, iv. cxlv.).

123. Pompey, “victor of countless kings and puppet os a scene‘' (Childc Harold, iv.
lxxxxvii).
