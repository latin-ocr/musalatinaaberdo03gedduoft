This nymphe (great king) come ever Thee so neure
That Thy harmonious Eares her Accents heare,
Give Pardon to her hoarse and lowlie Song.
Fain would Shee Troplacss to Thy Vcrtucs reare,
But for this Statlie Task Shee is not strong,
And her Defects Her high attempts doe wrong,
Yet as Shce could Shee makes Thy worth apperire.

With Heaven and blazing Starres doth Atlas stand,
So drawn by Chare-coale is Narcissus face :
Shee maye Aurora be to some bright Sunne
Which maye perfect the Day by Her begunne·

race and early days. Come to our embrace. Nay, fell Death may threaten his darts
now, that cannot hurt if you are seen. Thus did Laodamia breathe her last in the
arms of the shade Protesilaus. The world from pole to pole is searce your fellow.
Nor is such great glory due to Hercules, as to you, great king, to whom it has been
