IN PRAISE OF ANDREW LOGIE.

ARGUMENT.

Often did Logic fighting on a foreign shore with the mighty arms of reason put
down the arms and the very ehicss os Romc; victor also at home he exults, and
tramples on the soe hy reason, his sagacity‚ and thc holy word, which the father
himself of Olympus provided. The Archangel himself shall fall by this wcapon; the
hosts of Rome and the Popc lie will crusii with this penetrating sword, and bring
suin on all salse dogmas. He will loose all the knots that even the land of Italy
has opposed in times past to the true prcachers of the word.
