Scottish national eloquence, the famous speech by Lord Belhaven on the eve os the Union
Nov. 2, 1706, depends ior its effect upon the credencc everywhere attached to it; to-day it ixi
vouched sor in the long mythical series os portraits painted by De Wit on conti-act, in 1684-6,
sor the Picture Gallery of Holyrood.

The legend in sull bloom is seen first in John Fordun. Before him there were “only
short chronicles and lists of kings. The germs os much that was sabulous were to be sound
among them. interiningled with fragments ot truc history, but nothing like the spurious and
fictitious history os asxcrtimes then existed. In the Scoticlironicon these sablcs art,¹ found
digested into something like a chronological system, which formed the basis os the fictitious
superstructum invented by historians of the school os Ilcctor Boece; but the narrative of the
Scoticlironicon becomes more valuable during what may be called the historic period of
Scottish history ⁷' (Skene). Sir Georgo Mackenzie in his Defence os the Antiquity os 2112
Royal Line os Scotland rests his case on the forty kings deduced from Gathelus, son in law
of Pharaoh, and his spouse scota (Abcrd. Quatcr. semlies, p. 255).

Thomas Innes (1662-1744) ‘¹ was the first to assail the fabric os spurious history founded
by Fordun and completed and adorned by Boece and Buchanan, and in the Critical Essay
on the Amicii? Inlzalnlantszff Scotlaml (1729) he dispassionately and Iaboriously demolished
the whole legendary series os kings—the pertraits of them ate still in Holyrood—with which
our ancestors had peopled the seven dark centuries preceding the actual settlement of the
Scots in Dahiada. As the earliest to apply scientific methods to the Scottish historic legends
and to print the authentic Pictish chronicles, Innes takes rank as the veritable father of
Scottish history: nor is his position at all weakeried by the pretty evident fact that he was
stimulated partly by aJacobite dislike of Buchanan and a desire to disprove the numerous
stories of rebellion and depositum in the legendary chronicles” (Dr. Patrick in Chambers's
Cyclop. Eng. Litcr. (1902), ii. 302). The well-meant attempt at a union by Oliver Cromwell
was doomed to inevitable shipwreck on the incredulity of the people os Seotland to regard it
as anything else than a nesarious attempt to rob the national shareholders os their historical
dividend, and to transfer their stock from an old European house to the brand new Protector-
ate osa Huntingdonshire sarmer. ,

If any proof were needed of the pride of ‘¹' 'i he Scot Abroad'' in the national legend, it
would be found in its most convincirig form in Buchanan's Epithalamium in 1558 on the
marriage of Mary, Queen os Scots, to the Dauphin. Some thought it a poor match, but
Buchanan, in lines of splendid Latinity and real poetic fire, reminds France and all Europe
that Mary represents the oldest throne in Europe :—

¹⁴ Haec una centum de stirpe nepotes
Sceptriferos numerare potest. haec regia sola est
Quae bis dena suis includat secula sastis''.

For the attitude of Buchanan to the legendary kings, on whom John Major is much more
cautious and sceptical, see the luminous remarks of Professor Hume Erown in his Buchanan,
p. 305. Buchanan, the ‘¹ &Vandering Scholar '¹ and typica! Humanist of the day, viewed the
question not [rom the standpoint of research but from that of the man os letters and the
writer.

Come, Calliope, grant me this last task. Coy though you be to the prayer os
