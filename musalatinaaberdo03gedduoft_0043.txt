William Barclay (1570?-1f›3o Ρ), the Laureate os Tobacco and os the Spa well, was a
member of the house of 'rowie or Tolly which. at a later period. produced tht¹ Russian general
Barclay de Tolly, who succeeded Kutusoff and commanded at Leipsie the Russian troops against
Napoleon. He states the place os his birth. *⁸ Collonia (sic castrum vocatur in quo primurn
terram tetigi) sita est in littore quod tarn vasto atque aperto mari pulsatur, list in eodem
littore, in territorio gentis Barclayanae. portus quidam, qui nostra lingua Auldvlwavsn appel-
latur '' (Pracmetia to 1599 Paris ed, of Lipsius' Tacitus). lie has been osten confused with
the FrancoeAberdonian jurist of the same name, bnt was a brother os Sir Patrick Barclay of
ToIly, and apparently studied abroad. There seen-is no authority sor regarding him (Alma.
Quatcr. Studia, 339) as Μ.Α. os King's college. and the place from which hc held the
degrees of Μ.Α. and M.D. is unknown. He studied under the great scholar Justus Lipsius at
Louvain, and Baillie Skene (Book of Bon-Aesoni, p. 308) heard lrom one who had it from the
lips of Lipsius himself that, were he to die. he should wish his pen to fall to Barelay above all
others. He appears to have taught in the University os Paris, and to that city he professes
himself strongly attached.

His co-religionist Dempster, who doubtless was ac‘quainted with him, is the authority sor
the few facts known of hislise (Histor. Ecclcs. i. 120, ed. Irving).

‘⁶ Gulielmus Barclaius, nobilissimo loco ortus, baronis Tauvi suitur, generis magnitudinem
ingenii felicitate depressit. Parisiis humaniores literas cum ingenti oninium admiratione
professus est, quas Lovanii in schola Lipsii didicerat, cujus ad eum est epist. xxxiii. centur.
iii. Inde in scotiam profectus aliquantisper substitit, donec ministri illi sathanae magna cum
molestia afficientes solum vertere coegerunt, qui in Galliis iterum docere bonas artes sustinuit
Nanneti in Britannia Minore. Vivit adhuc in Scotia. et medicinam, ut aiunt, popularem
exercet.”

But, as Joseph Robertson notes, ¹· the only prosecution to which he appears to have been
exposed was a summons lrorn the Kirk Session os Aberdeen, to :insu-er for the sin os incon-
tinence, and he escaped without even a rebuke '¹ (Α beminen ΟΜΝ-ων. 231'd Sept. 1836 : ssouk us
Bon-Accord, p. 31071.).

Barclay's works are :—

and shows Barclay¹ like Salvation Yeo in Kingsley's Westward Ha, as the liulogist and
medical exponent of that ‘ holy herbe '. Compare the reinarkably similar Eulogy in the
Epigram by J. D[avies], in Cunningham's Marlozrw, p. 2268, xxxvi. ¹ Os Tobacco '.
