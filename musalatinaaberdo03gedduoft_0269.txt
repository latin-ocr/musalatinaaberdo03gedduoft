JAMES KEYTHE. 219

“The meaning os the epithet which Mr. James Keith here applies to himself, and which
he also uses when subscribing the other lines written by him, is not very obvious. Perhaps
the word is derived from μῖσος and ἀκμή, and may import‚ one: who dislikcs extremes '' (Shand,
Funerals, 1845, p. 424).

5. eras forsueris. Keythe also breaks out into this extraordinary piece of English verse
(Epitaplt, lxxi.) :—

Of all this An, the Universa! frame,

The Beautie Britane is, and Aberdene

Gives both a Grace and Grandour to the same;

For all is singular that there is seene :

But eminent above these all is One,

The chiese and highest honour of that Townc,

Late Praelate Patrick, Glorie os the Gowne⁴ . . .
Britane this All, and He grac'd Aberdone, '
And was an Ornament to all alone.
