xviii INTRODCCTION.

“The historiari of the early years of the University of Copenhagen, Thura, has
fortunately noted what other writers had passed over, the surnarne and birthplace
of Peter the Sem, whom lie callsl ‘Petrus havidis de Scotia Aberdonensis,’
which may be probably translated Peter Davidson (filius navidis) an Aberdonian.
From another author ‘2 we learn that Peter was not only a Professor but a diploma-
fist, and was sent by Hans in 1406 on nn Ernbassy to Rus-sia which secured the
alliance of Ivan the Terrible for the Danish King in his war against the Swedes
in return for η cession of the Swedish part of Finkrnd. These noticcs enable us
10 fix the principal dates in the life of Peter Davidson. He was born in 1450
either in the town or the diocese of Aberdeen, educated in Paris, where, as he
became Mastcr os the Sorbonne, he must probably have been at least as late as
1474, proceeded from there to Cologne, where he remained till 1479, when hc
was* called by Hans to Copenlmgen to superintend the faculties of arts and
theology in the New University, and he rernained in the Danish service till his
death of the plaigne in 1520.'’

Mackay conjectures that Davidson was probably educated at
one of the monastic schools of his native city, but the Grammar
school is as probable a source. He also noticed the migration
from Paris to Cologne as a satir indication that he belonged to the
Old Guard of the Smbonne, as Cologne was in Germany what
Paris was to France, the citadcl of the academie generation passing
away before the Reformed spirit. It may be remembered that
the year 1498. when Davidson received the doctorate, was that in
which Reuchlin visited Rome. ln 1509 he was consulted by the
Emperor lN'laximilian l.. to decide the question moved by the
Dominicans of Colognc, that all Jewish books except the Bible
should be burned. Rcuchlin opposed the decree, and the appear-
ance in 1511 of his Spe‘culum oculare led to his condemnation by
the Inquisition. After that, the battle passed to Ulrich von Hutten,
ancl the opponents of the Obscurantists (Dunkelmc'z'nner) of
(Iologne. Davidson therefore stood at the parting of the ways.

The earliest Aberdonian to see his book in print was James
