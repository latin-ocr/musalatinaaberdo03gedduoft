His religious controversies with the Catholics, 143-46‚ gave the royal pedantan opportunity
for making himself ludicrous in the eyes ot Europe. His persecution of the Dutch divine,
Conrad Vorstius, who succeeded to the chair os Arminius at Leyden in 1609, led him to bully
the Synod os Dort (Irving, Scotislz Pocts, ii. 244-47: cs. the line scene over this in Scott's For-
tnncs of Niga-l, ch. ix.). james was the last king to relight the fires of Smithfield. Bartholo-
mew Legate‚ an Arian lter-etio, was examined hythe king and bishop5‚ committed to Newgzne,
tried before the Consistory Court, and burned, 18th March, 1612. On 11th April, following
Easter Evc, Edward VVightman was burned at Liehfield. Yet, to Wedderburn and to the
party of Bishop Patrick Forbes, James appears the model ol* the Rex Pacificus, and the sol-

lower of the early Christian Church of Constantine. This is the Father of the ‘¹ Aberdcen
Doctors.''

ARGUMENT.

Shades of Buchanan and Muses of Du Bartas turn here, not that the vales os
Elysium may roll alost the eries of joy in their· bowery glades, but that the Cean
dirge may chant for your king the farewell strain. Ay, dead is the king, the Peace
Maker, best of Kings. All that wit, Prudence, &Vorth, the applause os the world,
and Plenty with her horn could effect, was stored that our age should rejoicc in its
peerless king. Why mention our age? I should doubt if his equal has ever lived.
What of Alexander and Cacsar : thunderbolts of war, purchasing the bubble reputa-
tion in streams of blood? But he had his name and glory frorn peace; such 1 may
believe were the happier days os man in the reign of old Saturn, and such the early
blooin of the age of gold. When Elizabeth sought the mansions of the blest‚ the
nobles of England saluted him as Lord and King; thus with love and law <lid one
win so many realmS.

I shall not mention his Scottish ancestry for 2000 years, those os English or
Freneh deseent; I pass by that as known, because in descent earth hath not his
fellow. I rather adrnire him for the justice that flourished in his reign. Mark the
ancient Scots, and the scattered Hebrid IsIes in the VVestern Sea; what butchery‚
what wild beasts were there ! What horrid crimes polluted not the Borders! pacified
now, so that you could think Minos had there set up his throne. Thus he effected
what his predecessors could never achieve; of such high account is Prudence.
With a mind like Solomon’s, his judgment ever adopted a tortuous course, and
would reach the goal by a side issue. This the Tagus learned, the Seine, the rolling
Danube, and the lion in the clothing of the fox conquered the harlot of Rome. Not
that candour and good saith were wanting, as every attendant of his mother felt
from his earliest days. His royal dignity neither made war nor engaged in his
neighbour's war·

Religion has imposed on the French a burden they can hardly bear3 Germany
has long suffered in like manner: the Vistula and the Po have groaned. But the
