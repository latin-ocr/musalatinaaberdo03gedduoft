l. Hls BROTHER’S EPITAPH.

A reference to the will of Thomas Reid (Fasti Acad. Mar. i. ¹95) and of Dr. Alexander
Reid (i. 235) will show there were seven brothers: Thomas, Alexander, Robert (Minister of
Banchory). James, Peter, John (Scott‘s Fasti, iii. 521), and Adam, the Regem in Marischal
College and Minister of Methlick (Fasti Acad. Mur. ii. p. 3.›). All are excluded from re-
ference here explicitly, with the exception of John. Robert Chambers (Biog. Dict. i. 415) says
Buchanan's History ⁴¹ was translated into the Scottish language by John Reid, who, according
to Calderwood's MS, was servitor to Mr. Georgo Buchanan. A MS. of this unpublished
version is in the library os the University of Glasgow.'' On the confused identification os this
John Reid, see ‘¹ George Buchanan,’¹ Glasgort* Quatcr. Studics, 1906, pp. 48, 49, 517.

Aizoumsssrs.

The Furies, dire band, could not by their threats frighten Reid from the path of
right, an armed soldier os Heaven. Not daring to assail him sace to face, they
attack hirn behind. A cancer sastens on either shoulder. Alecto eries: ‘¹ Let virtue
seek Heaven above, a home on Earth has been undermined by our wiles'’.

Ι. EPITAPH IUM FRATRIS.

Dira cohors Furiae, Rhaedum quem tramite recti
Exterrere suis haud potuere minis;

Hoplomachum caeli armatum, mystamque Tonantis,
Hostem Erebi, invictum pectore, voce, manu :

5 Terga viri (coram non ausa lacessere) nigro

Felle petunt: humerum cancer utrumque premit.

Alecto exclamat, Virtus sibi caelica quaerat,
'ferrea sunt nostris subruta tecta dolis.

3. ὁπλομάχος.
Ex Italico. (From the Italian.)
Life on land is like life on sea. The non-swimmer sinks.
Ut Neptuniis in undis, sic in orbe vivitur.
Quisquis hie natare nescit, protinus submergitur.
E Graeco. (From the Greek.)
Gout is the true child of its parents, Bacchus and Venus.

Patris Euhii solvilumbi et solvilumbae Cypridis
Lenta nascitur podagra, solvilumba filia.
