DIRGE FOR PATRICK FORBES.

ARGUMENT.

Ifyou seek his descent, he was the hero of Corse. If you ask his carly training,
the Clyde that knows it is not yet silent over it. St. Andrews itself, where the
Muses of Seotland justly raise their head, claims from him fresh titlcs to praise. As
he was in youth the ornament ofthe Muses, so he was in age the chief glory of the
senate and the mitre. Nor did his manhood belie his youth and age. His honour
ever grew steadily.

ΙΙ.

If notable signs bespeak a notable nature, Forbes carried oss every vote. A
winning and gracious amiability shone in his face, united to a grave dignity ol
manner. His words, dashed with nectar, hovered on his sacred lips, and gave thus
an additional weight to his utterance. His mere reading, wonderful to tell,
explained any dark page in a book that might occur. As his beart was stored with
the hidden wisdom of Minerva, so his tongue was the happy dispenses of the siches
of his mind. It was the care of Heaven that all human good, all that befits a
bisbop, should pass to him alone.

111.

Ten lustra and seven more he completed, strong in mind, in courage, in pen and
counsel. Is, for merit’s sake, years gave way to virtues, he should have counted an
infinity of days.
