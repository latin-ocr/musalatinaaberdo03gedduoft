Kcnncdy, you seem rearcd at the breast of Pallas, such is your milky vein and
flowing style. No wonder that such a piercing wit unde-rhos your lines, Sharpc is
the guide and companion of your mind.

Epigmmnm,

Magna Caledoniae mystarum gloria: sacrum
Insula cui crinem cingit et ambit honos.
Grampigenum cui summa sacrum moderamina rerum
Commissa, aetheria Prosperitate vigent:
Haec, modo ruricolas graviora negotia Musas
Admittant, facili suscipe dona manu.
Nascentique fave, Praesul venerande, Camenae:
prodiit auspiciis nostra Thalia tuis.

Epigram to the Most Reverend Fathcr in Christ, james, by divine compassion
and royal designation. the most worthy Archbishop os St. Andrcws, and
Primate of all Scotland.

Great glory of Scotland’s priesthood: whose brow the mitre encircles: to whom
is entrusted the chief rule in sacred matters, and under whom they show a heavenly
prosperity: graciously receive this ofsering, should your heavier tasks give an admis-
sion to the rura} muse. Favour‚ reverend Prelate, the Muse at its birth ; our sportive ο
Muse has made its appearance under your auspices,

ARGUMENT.

Phoebus had scarce spread his golden light in mid-heaven when Moeris sat
down among the shadowy willows, with his shepherd's head garlanded. His pipe
no longer hung sadly on the bough, nor grated harshly its rude plaint, but while it
teaches the vales to resound its master's joy, it drives the woods to wag their tops.
soon as shepherd Corydon, in the prime of life and a newcomer in Scotland,s;1w
him rejoicing in the flickering shade, he draws near and thus addresses him :—

Cor. &Vhoever you are that lie under the shady willow, and sway the woods by
the sweetness of your pipe, tell me (the goats will here crop in safety the gay mead)
the cause of your joy.
