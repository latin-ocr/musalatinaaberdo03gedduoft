JouN LEECH 273

XVIII. QUlT'slNG SCOTLAND, OCTOBER 1, 1617.

This was clearly sent to Scot of Scotstarvet, from the reply which is preserved in Delitiac
Poet. scot. ii. μὴ, 482. The steady Scot there advises him to drop the r‹')le os erotic poet and
betakc himself to the serious study of a profession. Lccch was a Master of Arts ot three
years' standing and apparently was endangering his prospecte». On his tour by land or
sea Apollo and the Graces will have him in their keeping 2—-

“ Hoc praeeunte viam carpes securus ubique,
Nulla tImenda sali, nulla pericla soli.
Blanda trias Charitum semper tibi serviet uni,
Haerebit lateri mellea Suada tuo.
Sive libet Ligerim celerem, magnumve Garumnam
Seu Rhodanum, rapidis qui mare turbat aquis,’' etc.‚ etc.

lf he reaches Venice or Rome, he will be able 2——

“ Consulere Hippocratem vel docti scripta Galeni,
Materies studiis aptior illa tuis.
Vel, tibi si placeant, priscorum volve sophorum
Dogmata . . .
AspIcis ut summos det Iustinianus honores.
Si libet arguti discere iura fori.
Aspicis ut tritam referat tua Musa lacernam,
Possideatque minus quam miser Irus opum.’'
He fears his advice will be of no use, and advises the erotic poet to concontrate on an epic, as
unwisely as his friends pressed Burns to devote himself to a great drama :—
¹¹ Aut tu sublimi volita super alta cothurno,
Aut cane Maeonia bella canenda tuba ;
Hac iter ad celsi frondosa cacumina Pindi,
Haec erit ingenio digna Camena tuo.¹'

ARGUMENT.

Land powerful in men and mental products, whether fierce Mars calls to the
field and you rush to the fray covered with Thracian dust; or whether there is need
of mind, the care os stern Minerva, the glory and honour of the Pierian choir‚
whether you owe your sceptre to Fergus, or to Gathelus, or derive your name
Scotlaml from the Scytlzian streams, land ruled over in unbroken line by a hundred
kings and more down to your name, James ‚ kindly land, farewell awhile.
You grant this, land dearest of all, Scotland, or native country if you will. The
quiet Loire summons me, the rushing Rhone, Seine, chief of waters, the Garonne
descending from its tiny source, where it seeks the main in darkling wintry flood.
Here Phoebus and the band of the Muses promise me rest, while my own dear Scot
refuses no trouble on behalf of his poet friend, and lends me his aid in absence.
Dear fostering land, while you remember me keep ever him for me, whether the
fates grant me a return or a grave. How can they grant me them is he abides with
you and lives as my friend ? Let him live and so abide. Thus, though dead and
though absent, I now live with you, and die with you.
