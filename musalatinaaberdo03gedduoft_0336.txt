286 MUSA LA'rlNA ABERDONENSIS.

ARGUMENT.

The name which Venus has set on her shaft, the name by which Cupid loves
to sport, the name with which by the Boeotian sount Phoebus delights to strike the
lyre, the name beyond all others known to the Muses, which the triad of the Graces
would wish their own, loving peace and fit for a thousand graces, indulged by
suasion, whose wit leaves no sting, the name that soumis harmonically in the ear of

Jove when Ganymede mixes the cheerful cup, the name in which earth, breezeS, the
sea all blend—what? Ayton.

Nomen Acidalia quod fixit arundine Cypris‚
Nomen quo Paphius ludere gestat Amor,
Nomen Hyantaeis quo sese oblectat in undis,
Dum tereti Phoebus pollice pulsat ebur,
5 Nomen quo Musis non ullum notius audit,
Esse suum Charitum quod bona triga velit,
Nomen pacis amans et mille leporibus aptum,
Cui Suada indulget, cui sine felle Iocus,
Nomen in harmonico quod Iupiter audit Olympo,
io Dum miscet Phrygius pocula laeta puer,
Nomen quo tellus, auraeque, atque humor aquai,
Cunctaque concordant ; dic quod? Aitonius.
