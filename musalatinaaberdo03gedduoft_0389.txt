Professor R. Laneiani, Rome, informs me that he is buried in the Church os Santa
Maria degli Angeli, in Thermis Diocletiani,- the church being built by Michael
Angelo out of the cella caldaria. For description of chureh, see Story’s Roba di
Roma, p. 469 (1876). By permission os Pope Gregory XIII. he was succeeded by his
nephew. For Chisholm and the Darnley marriage, see Tytler, iii. 206.

Vaison, 1629. Dempster‚ Hister. Eccl. i. 181. For the dedication to Chisholm of
Scot’s 1601 Vocabularium Utriusquc chris, sec Abcrd. Qualer. Studies, p. 243.

ARGUMENT.

Learned Chisholm, the Church's ornament and the glory of the faithful, to
whom virtue has given renown, it is uncertain which of the two owes more, you to
the Bridc of the Lord or She to you. She indier care has bestowed virtues and
wealth, and a splendid mitre. To the banished She has given a country, to the exile
rest, and the world's admiration. You restore to Her life and honour, with you as
guide liberty has been won for Her children. With the soe crushed, She revisits in
triumph and joy Her country through your meanS. Which owes the more is un-
certain; but the debt is mutual. For you are the ornament of the Eride, the Bride
is glory to you.

AUCTOREM.

[Examm Confessionis Fidei Calvinianetc quam Scotis subscribendam proponunt. Aven. 1601.]

Ecclesiae decus et sanctae pia gloria turbae,
Vivida cui virtus nomina clara dedit,

Debeat incertum est quis plus, Cheisolrne diserte,
Tu Domini Sponsae, Sponsa vel ipsa tibi.

5 Virtutes et opes, dignum splendore galerum,

Vitamque et mores provida Sponsa tulit.

Extorri patriam, profugo dedit illa quietem 3
Miretur quod te mundus et illa dedit.
