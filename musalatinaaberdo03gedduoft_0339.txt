XXVII. TO CELURCA, WHICH Now IS CALLED lew
MONTROSE.

See the lines on Montrose by Arthur Johnston (Musa, ii. 274, 275) and by John John-
ston, ss.

ARGUMENT.

Let the Thespian sistcrs dictate to me their swcet song, and let Phoebus grant
me his numbers. Montrose, the Muses or the God of the Golden Lyre cannot adom
you beyond your merit. Flora gives her choicest gists; Cere& not yet wailing her
lost Proserpine, with bountcous hand encircles the circuit of your walls. 'I'he God
of the sea grants wealth, genially sustains your solk, and enriches them with his
glassy waves. Flora, Ceres, Nereus all join.

XXVII. IN CELURCAM, QUAE NUNC NOVA MONTISROSA
DICITUR.

Carmina Thespiacae dictent mihi blanda sorores,
Et Phoebus numeros donet habere suos;
Ultra te nequeunt, Celurca, ornare sororeS‚
Vel deus auratam qui ferit arte lyram :
5 Certat ubique deus, sic dat sua munera Flora,
S=c decorat vernam fertile gramen humum.
Farre Ceres (neque enim natam iam plorat ademptam),
CIrcumdat larga moenia tuta manu.
Ipse mariS dat opes domitor, populumque benignus
10 Sustinet et vitreiS dives inaurat aquis,
Flora, Ceres, Nereus, decorat, circumdat, inaurat,
Terram, urbem, populum, gramme, farre, boniS.

The lines appear in the 1623 edition, with some verbal alterations, and with the headIng
“ In Celurcam, vulgo Montisrosam, natalem suam urbem ¹¹.

XXVIII. TO THOMAS DEMPSTER, PROFESSOR OF
JURISPRUDENCE AT BOLOGNA.

See on Dempster‚ s.v. Α kindly reference to the wanderer. who has rescued from ·‘ dark-
nessn so many names of compatriots. They have “come h0me‚'’ and “enjoy their own
again ’' through him. There is the usual pun on σκότος and ScotIa. 'she epIgrams on him in
Irving's Preface do not miSs it. One ItaIIan says of him :—

Εἲς, θωμᾶ, σκότος οὐδὲ σκότος, μάλα δ’ ἐν σκοτέεσσι
Ἐν πάτρᾳ σοῦ καὶ πάντοθι φωτοδότης.
