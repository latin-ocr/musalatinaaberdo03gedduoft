Lutea ab Eoo procedens littore bigis

Aurora, astrifero (traheret Phoebeius axis

Cur tantas mirata moras) fulgebat Olympo.

Cynthius ipse graves versans sub pectore luctus,

Vestibus, obscuris involverat ampla tenebris

Tecta; ac interea moestis mandaverat Horis

Ut volucres paterentur equos praesepibus altis

Vesci, quo liceat merito indulgere dolori.
