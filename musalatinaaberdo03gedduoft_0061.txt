ARGUMENT.

Ι see the Muses in mourning, Melpomene with her locks disin-velleri, in amazo-
ment, with her tear-stained cheeksy filling the air with her loud eries. 'l'ell me,
Muse‚ what is the cause? Not far from this to the South is the right ample home
of the ancient racc, raised alost on its proud rock. Some years back there shone
forth a glorious hero worthy of his sires; we hoped he would be sor ever with us.
but vain were our prayers. He has fallen. Within thirteen revolutions os the sun
since his father’s death, the son follows, but in a different way. Failing strength
had not beset him, nor were there white hairs round his active brow, his body was
vigorous and comely⁴ None so active as he.

He has,however, fallen in mid-life, like the upiurning os a ‹leep-rooted forest.
Meanwhile, the descent of the raee is amply provided f0r; unwed yet, he is not at
horne to pay the last rites to his father's shade, and lay his bones in earth, secking
abroad to tread in his grandsire¹s steps and pursuing wisdom. Resides, he (Williani)
was not yet equal to his father (George, founder of Marisehal College) ; that had
been allotted to his old age, for can any one doubt that like sons spring from noble
fathers? Barren ash trees spring not from vines. Virtue, ever growing with his
growing years, afforded pledges of his future lot, never puffed up with fortune, never
despising the needy, but in speech affable to all, ever sparing of his words Such
were his growing virtues, but now death ends all.

Ι do not from his end prepare to impeach sate, nor does my mind presumo to
carp at the Sisters Three. My prayers are directed to God, the ruler of the world.
By thy will has he been removed, our place is not to ask why, nor does the skill of
the mind of man grasp so high designs. why strive to know what 1 may not know?
All thou dost is holy, which alone sufficeth. The rest Ι wisely know not, and 1 will

not proudly pry into it. Thy glory shines in all thy workS, so let the nations praise
Thee for ever.

IN WILHELMUM, COMITEM MARESCHALLUM.

[Lacltrymae Academiae Marcschallanac, Aberd. Raban, 1635]

Aspicio nigra torpentes veste Camenas,
Melpomenen video turbatis lege capillis,
Attonitam, madidisque genis, clamoribus auras
Complentem querulis nudataque pectora pugnis
