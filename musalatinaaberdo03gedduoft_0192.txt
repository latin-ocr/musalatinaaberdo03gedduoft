150 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

ST. REGULUS, 01³ ST. ANDREWS.

O‘er ocean’s marge with streets of equa} space
Encircled with a rich and fertile soil,

While priestly wealth and splendour it did grace,
Here bearn’d the mitre’s radiance without foil3

The Muses‘ domes here raise to Heav’n their heads,
Delight os mortals and delight of gods.

The nymphs and Phoebus haunt the leafy glacies:
Urania foremost in the blest abodes.

Thou who receiv’rl'st me from Teutonic coasts
Returning, and to lofty rank advanc’d,

Thrice happy city, who such honours boasts
By Phoebus and the Muses reign enhanc'd.

Ye gracious powers! sar hence all evils drivc,
Let Peace and Picty here ever thrive.

Ama οι( ΑΕΜΑ.

*ΑυΙεὶ Λ)τ’; Johnston's second line recalling precisely Burns's tribute, “wham ne’er a
town surpasses for honest mcn,'' etc. This famous quotation is doubtless due to the expression
of ssuchanan (i. 20): ¹¹in universum regio est scrtzrr'or virorum sortium quam frugum aut
pecorum ”. The hiztorian's description of the poor soil is the subject osa striking remark on
the Ayrshire peazantry by Burns on his Highland tour (Globe Burns, Macmillan, p. 575).

Parva urbs, ast ingens animus in fortibus haeret,
Inferior nulli nobilitate vistim.

Aeris e campis haurit purissima caels1m‚
Incubat et miti mollior aura solo.

5 Aeria hinc, non Αενιι prius, credo, illa vocata est,

Cum duris quid enim mollia iuris habent?

Infera cum superis quod si componere fas est,
Aurea sors dici debuit illa prius.

5. Arthur Johnston (Musa, ii. 264) makes the same play on the derivation from air and
brass (affre, aere).

Am.

This little town a mighty spirit boasts,
Second to none for sons of noble racc,
Heaven sends its purest influcncc on its coasts,
And mildcst scasons fertilisc the place.
From hence Αὲνὶιι first, not Aemi called:
For what has mildest air with brass to do?
lf things below with things above compare,
The name of Αιινειι were its justes due.
