226 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

charge. Spalding has a characteristic note on this. ‘¹ Sunday the roth of July [1640], Mr.
David Leech, Minister at Logie, and principall outstander and gainestander of the covenant,
and who had left his chureh, his charge, his countrie‚ and gone into England. as ye may read
before, at last he returns home, becomes penitent‚ and the forsaid Sunday he in Old Aberdein
preached ane penetentiall sermon, directed be our kirk, whilk that day was not found satisfactorie ;
therforv he was once againe ordained to preach upon the 14th os September ane other pene-
tentiall sermon in the kirk of New Aberdein. whilk he did. and was found satisfactorie; where-
upon he was kindly received to his kirk and charge. whilk he was loath to want, and therfor
yeilded first.'' He was admitted to Kemnay in 1650, and continued there till 1653, when in
October he was deprived for deserting his charge, it being stated that he had a church not far
from London.

It is said <Maidment's catalogue. p. 121) that he “was one of the Chaplains to King
Charles 11. and also of the army that went into England ”. This has been generally taken to
refer to the expedition of the Engagers under Hamihon, crossing the Border on Sth July, 1648,
and cut to pieces by Cromwell after three days' fighting (Aug. 17th-19th) at Prest0n‚ Wigan
and NVarringtoiu sor the statement is made that after being chaplain he settled at Kemnay.
But, if words have any soree, it must relate to the expedition under Charles ΙΙ., ending at Wor·
cester, 3rd September, 1651v which is the subject of Kennedy's Aeneas Britannicus (q.v.), and
this would better suit the subjects treated in his latest issue of 1657.

In that year Leech published Part-rga navidis Leochan' Scotobritanni. Operis pars
prior Hernicorum. Elegiarnm et Epigramma-rium. Londini. Excutit-bat Franciuus Lcach.
Anu, Dom. 1657 12mo. This excessively rare volume has been recovered this year (1907),
aster a strennous search in all the great public and private libraries of the country, and adver-
tisement in the Scottish press. Α copy has been found in the library of Trinity CoHege,
Cambridge, and sorwarded sor inspection through Professor Henry Jackson. Since then
another copy. which had belonged to David Laing, has been found in the possession of Dr.
David Murmy. Glasgow. Both copies, strangely enough, agree in the loss of some pages,
cancelled at the same place. The contents show new facts in Leech's life, and some extracts
are included in this selection. The book is dedicated to Mary, Duchess os Richmond and
Lennox, and has an ‘¹ Epicediurn in Funere jacobi Ducis Richmond et Leviniae.'¹ There are
lines to Bulstrode Whitelockv on his departure as ambassador to Sweden and on his return;
lines to the same, pro liberatione a vinculis, to the Countess of Peterborough‚ to Baton Thomas
Gray of NVark, to the Reverend Presbyters at Ongar in Essex. to Edmvnd Calamy, to the Earl
of Warwick, to the Harl of Pembroke, ¹⁴ De se dum in vinculis,'¹ arevival, no doubt, of his
brother John's connection with that family; to Baron Fleetwood‚ to Edward Palmer (to whom
the book in Trinity College, ‘⁴ ex dono E. ΡηΙηιειηΠ possibly belonged). and to many others.
These show him at least surrounded by a large and influential circle of friends, and his con-
nection with Thomas Fuller is particularly interesting. It seems preferable to connect his
imprisonment with a date Subsequent to the Engagement, and following closely on the
‘'crowning mercy'' at VVorcester.

ln other quarters we catch a glimpse of Leech before this date. In 1648 there was a plan
in the Chnrch sor preparing additions to the psalmody‚ and Leech was worked in this connec-
tion. The Commissioners appointed dcsired an opinion on ⁸· Mr. David Leitch’s papers of
Poeeie,” and the following was written to the Presbytery of lillon :—
