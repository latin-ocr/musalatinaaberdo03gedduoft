Canon Paul, Braemar, has, with the approval of Bishop
Chisholm, one of the vice-presidents of the Club, brought under
the notice of the Council the MS. szmsmz or BAp‘rrsMs IN
ST. ANDREw's CATIIOLIC Carmen, BRAEMAR. The two volumes
of the Register extend over the period 1703-1757‚ and contain

os the Rector of St. Drostan's‚ Deer (referred to in former Reports
to the Club), of which the first volume covers the period 1681-
1718.

preservative that decay would be arrestcd. The only part os the
monument really badly wasted is the raised lettering, which had
always been rather thin and fragile. Nothing can be done to
restore it. . . . If the New Spalding Club can afford it, I think it
would be much better¹ to insert bronze panels with raised letters.

you exact estimates.’' The Council is of opinion that the Club
