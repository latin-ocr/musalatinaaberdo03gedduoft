JOHN Row.

John Row, second son of John Row, minister of Carnock and author of The History os
the Kirk os Scotland, 1558-1637‚ and grandson of the well-known reformet of the same name,
was born at Carnock, about 1598sand educated at the University of st. Andrews, graduating
MA from St. Leonard's College, 1617. He became master os the Grammar School os Kirk-
caldy, and in 1632 was transferred to the Rectorship of the Grammar School of Perth, which
enjoyed at that time a very great repute. A knowledge of Hebrew had been hereditary in the
family (M‘Crie’s Knox, p. 375, for grandfather; Row's History, ed. Laing„ p. 466, for father),
and this language was taught by Row at Perth, where he drew up a Grammarv dedicated in
1637 to a former pupil os his, the Earl of Kinnoul.

In 1641 Row, who had entered the ministr-y, was translated to Aberdeen, as minister of
St. Nicholas Church, and Spalding. the local chronicler, who never misses an attack on him
and Andrew Cant. on frivolous grounds, thus introduces his enemy (Memorialls, ii. 89) : ¹· Mr.
Johne ReW, scool maistcr at Sanct Johnstoun, by convoy of Mr. Androw Cant, is brocht to
Abirdein, quhair he baid his tryellis, being bot ane young man, and thair efter wes admittit
minister at Abirdein. Mr. John Oswall„ minister at Pencaithland‚ wes, by order ol' the
generall assemblim apointit to be translatit thairfra to Abirdein, quhair he cam with his wys
and famelie, to serve as ane minister. This ministeris, with the said Mr, Androw Cant, cam
not be the tounes seiking, or free electioun, as they war wont to do, bot imposit vpone them
be assemblies one way.‘' On Nov. 23„ 1642, the Provost and Council ordained that a Hebrew
lesson be given weekly in Marischal College, and the Principal Patrick Dun was instructed to
secure the service of Row. On Sept. 20, 1643, the Councn, in consideration of the dedication
of his Hebrew dictionary to Provost Patrick Leslie and the Town Council, assigned to him
400 merks Scots.

Row’s Hebraea· Lingua Institueiancs appeared at Glasgow in 1644. This is said by
David Laing to be the first work of the kind ever printed in Scotland. In England, however.
William Symson, minister os Dumbarton, had printed in London, 1617, his Reguhe de
tlt-centibus Hebraicis (M⁴Crie's Andrew Melville, pv 388 n.: sor the laek of Hebrew and
Greek type in Scotland in 1579, see his Knox, pp. 309. 386). Row's work was commended to
the Church by the General Assembly in 1646. In Aberdeen he acted with the Covcnanting
minority, and in March, 1645, along with Professor William Douglas, he had to seek
refuge within the walls of Dunnottar Castle (spalding. ii. 451. 459). He continued the
History of his father down to July, 1639. under the quaint title os An Handfrd os Goat's
Haire, for the Furtlzering af the Builaz'ng of the Tabernaclc, and he appears also to have
meditated the preparation ol a History ⁰f the Times.

On the deposition of Dr. Guild from the Principalship of King's College, the Cromwellian
Commissioners appointed Row in 1652 to the office. ln October os the same year the new
Principal along with John Menzies, Professor os Divinity at Marischal College, and John
Scaton, minister in Old Aberdeen, was charged by the Church with separating themselves
