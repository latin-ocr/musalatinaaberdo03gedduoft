Odcs, Ι, iii. 9-24, as his text. “It is, perhaps, impossible to ascertain the epoch
when the polarity of the magnet was first known in Europe. The common opinion
which ascribes its discovery to a citizen of Amalfi, in the fourteenth century, is un-
doubtedly erroneous. Guiot (le Provins, a French poet, who lived'about the year
1200, or, at the latest, under St. Louis, describes it in the most unequivocal language.
James de Vitry, a bishop in Palesssne, before the middle of the thirteenth century,
and Guido Guinizzeni, an Italian poet of the same time are equally explicit. . .
It was not till the beginning of the sourteenth century that the Genoese, and other
nations around that inland sea, steercd into the Atlantic Ocean towards England
and Flanders.” flauam, Middle liges, pp. 624, 625‚ed. 1869. Plura in Bury‘s Gibbon,
vi. 190.

“The magnetic needle appears to have been known to the Chinese from quite
ancient times, and utilised on their junks as early as the eleventh century. The
Arabs, who voyaged to Ceylon and Java, appeared to have learnt its use from the
Chinese‚ and it is probably from thern that the inariners of Barcelona first intro-
duced its use into Europe. The first mention ot it is given in a treatise on Natural
History by Alexander Neckham, foster-brother os Richard Coeur de Lion. Another
reference, in a satirical poem os the troubadour, Guyot os Provence (1190), states
mariners can steer to the North Star without secing it, by following the direction of
a neeclle floating in a straw in a basin os water, after it had been touched by a mag-
net. But little use⁷ however, seems to have been made of this, for Brunetto Latini,
Dante's tutor, when on a visit to Roget Bacon in 1258, states that the sriar had
shown him the magnet and its properties, but adds that, however useful the dis-
covery, ‘ no master mariner would darc to use it, lest he should be thought to be a
magician ’ ” (Story Os Gsographica! Discovcry, J. JacobS, 1899, p. 65). Hallam doubts
if Flavio Gioja. os Amalfi, who has been claimed sor some improvement or invention,
ever existed. ’

[Delitiac Poc!. Scot. il. 255.]

Quisquis erat, meruit senii transcendere metas,
Et fati nescire modum, qui mystica primus
Sensa animi magicis docuit signare figuris,
Et captiva novis concludere verba tabellis.

5 Obstupuere rudes animae commercia linguae
Absentes agitare viros, mentisque patere
Arcanas sine voce fibras, interprete penna.
Candida perplexis distinguitur area sulcis
Et niveos atro tractus signante veneno

ιο Vomer arat, raptas volucri quae prodere rupem
Abnuit enixis clivi in fastigia Gallis.
