WILIAAM JOIINSTON.

William Johnston was the sixth and youngcst son of George Johnston of (hat ilk and
Caskiebzn (Musa, ii. p. xv.), and of Christian Forbes. daughter of William, the severrth Lord
Forhes. It has been assumed that both he aud his elder brother, Artium studied at Marischal
College, but this is more than doubtful; and as it is certain that William matriculated at
Heidelberg in 1603 (Abrrd. Quater. Rccord, p. 434). he could not have been the bajmz of
Maris-chal College of 1605v with whom he has been identified (Fasti Acad. Mar. ii. 53 and 188).
Smith (Oratio, 1702, p. 24) says he had been a professor nt Sedan, and in Miehel's Erossais, ii.
167 n. it is distinetly said that William taught successively the humanitics and philosophy at
Sedan. But his name is not mentioned in Charles l'eyran's Hist. ds· l'ncad. dr Scdan
(Fasti Asad. Mar. ii. 53) and M. Brincourt of Sedan (the writer of Appendix Il. in vol. ιῐ.
of the Musa) writing ιο Colonel Johnston on the 4th May, 1896, says “Dans mes
recherches je n'ai jamais eu connaissance du frere cadet (l‘Arthur Johnston, et je crois qu’il
n'a jamais ete professeur a Sedan.'' There is therefore little doubt that confusion has arisen
between his and his elder brother Arthur's career, as the latter was unquestionably professor os
metaphysics at Sedan. He was elected a burgess of Aberdeen, znd July, 1623, and became
first professor of mathematies in Marischal College, elected on May 3, 1626. He died on
June 14, 1640 (spalding, i. 283), having married the fifth and youngest daughter of Forbes
of Blacktoune iri Aberdeenshire„ by whom he had one son and two daughters (Genealogical
Account os J‘olmston os that* Hk, Edinb. 1832, pp. 38, 39).

Gordon os Rothiemay (Scols Affinis, iii. 208-10) notes the deaths of Dr. William Forbes,
Gordon the Mediciner, Dr. Alexander Ross, and then adds: ‘Thes wer followed by Dr.
William Johnstone, professor of the mathennticke in The Colledge Marischall of New Aber<
deene, a gentleman who in his younger yeares had been bredd in Spainev and professed
philosophy in the chaire of Nemause in qunce, weall seen both in the mathematickes and
medicine. He died June fourteenth. before the sixtieth year os his age. suffocated with a
squinanee, a disease to which he was most subjecte, being a corpulent man, and a sanguineam:
he was tackne awaye for the greate greefe os his freends and acquaintance.’' “Among the
MSS. in the library of Marischal College is Gulielmi Johnstoni Praelectiones Mathematicae
dictatae in Academia Marischallana, 1633 '¹ (collectivus Abcrd. and Banff, 54 n.; Fasti Acad.
Mar. ii⁴ 207 n. 2).

Johnston would seem to have enjoyed a wide reputation. “He wrote on the Mathe-
maticks; his skill in the Latine was treuly Ciceronian⁷⁷ (Maidment's Catalogues, pt 114).
David Wedderburn has lines on his death* ⁴* He was a good poet in Latine, and a good
mathematician acknowledged to be such (which was none of his meanest praises) by Master
Robert Gordon of Straloch, one of the ablest men of Scotland in the mathematical faculties ''
(Sir T. Urquhart’s Tracts, Edinb. 1774, p. 125). ·‘ De Gulielmo,⁷' eries Andrew Strachan, in
