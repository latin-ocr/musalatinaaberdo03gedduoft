JollN KER.

Yet neither eld nor time's destroying rago

Can hlight your worth from out our grateful scroll,
(iarden, and Fraser, Strachan. Reid the sage

And Burnet, whom with others we enrol
In Ilonour's brightest list deep graven within our soul.

Nor unsung herc in this our heartfelt song
The givcrs of our bursaries, and so
(Scant tho’ the space and tho' the list bc long)
'Tis fitting that futurity should know
Smne chosen few, while yet with us below—
&Vatty Bram, Melvill, Adam, Burnct best,
l'ark, Fullartom and NVatson, long ago
who with Greig, Ogilvie, and Falconer, rest
Have found above and join‘d the mansions of the blest.

Unsound the while was still our little state,
The home of Elphinstone nods to its fall,
While all around confess the impending fate
And wreck and ruin in their train appal
The view with mould’ring heaps: the tall
And stately pile Dunbar had rear'd lay low.
Loud from the hills the Harpies, too, would call,
Backward we saw the darkling current flow.

While Hunger foul and &Vaut would not our doors forego.

'Twas then our wish some courier to send

To Jove¹s bright realm above the starry skies,
To tell our woeful story and some friend

Win, with an ear for our deep grief and sighs.
Thus stand we so resolved at last. Forth flies

Our message: ‘⁵' Gracious Father, mark our plight,
In all Thy Majesty do Thou asise

And scatter these foul Harpies of the night,
And let the stricken Muse find favour in thy sight?

Swift in his course by day and night the ears
Of the celestials with his tale he plied,
Nor was great Jove averse to sighs and tears,
Summoning the heavenly Quaestors to his side.
But they, alas, our cause no further tried
But call’d on us the ways and means to show.
All further aid to us was then denied;
Man's frail estate and heritage below
Find in such crowded com-ts but scant repose to woe.
