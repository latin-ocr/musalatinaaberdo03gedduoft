[ln Epistolam Pauli ad Ephesios, Robcrti Rodii α Trochorigia Scoli. Lond. 1652]

Iam modo fluctivagi rabie prope naufraga Nerei
Navigat in portu navrs onusta suo.
Per mare, per terras, per tot discrimina sospes
Securo liber hic tramite liber eat.
5 Caesaris innocuam quondam praesentia pinum
Dicitur in tumido sustinuisse salo.
Ipsa procelloso fuerit licet obruta ponto,
Tuta satis Christi nurnine puppis erat.
Culte liber! quae te vexit quaecunque carina
10 Thesauri tanto pondere tuta fuit ;
Ne timeas, rabidos modo praetergresse liburnos,
Qua patet immensi vimque minasque soli.
