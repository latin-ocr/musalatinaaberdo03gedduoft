272 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

It is remarkable that one passage of the Earl os Stirling has become household through
its imitation by Shakespeare. George Steevens showed that the famous passage in The
Tcmpcsl, w. i. 150-56, on “the cloud-capt towers'' is taken from The Tragedie of Darius
(Edinb. 1603), here quoted as a specimen of his style 2-

“ Let greatnesse of her glascie scepters vaunt :
Not sceptours, no, but reeds, soone brus’d soon broken:
And let this wordlie pomp our wits inchant.
All fades, and scarcelie leaves behinde a token.
‘fhose golden Fallaces, those gorgeous halles,
With sourniture superfluouslie faire:
Those statlie Com-ts, those sky-encountring walles
Evanish all like vapours iu the ‘’tire''

XVII. NEMESIS POETICA.

Nemesis Pociica: Edinburgi. Iixcudebat Andreas Hart. Anno Domini 1617. Leech’s
activity during the Annus ,llirabilis os 1617 had been excessive. It embraced in all
Iani illaliscri Sfrcna : 1617, 4⁰. Finlason, Edin.
Iani sperantis δίη-πα .- 1617, 4⁰. Finlason, Edin.
Laclrrymuc and Daphnis .· 1617, 4⁰. Finlason, Edin.
Ncmssis Ροεηλ-(1 .· 1617. 4⁰. A. Hart, Edin.
Nemo ε 1617, γ’. Fin'ason. Edin.

See mdis, Lis! ιη’ Printcd Books, p. ¹10· The attempt< os Leech to attract notice had all
sailed, and in chagrin he retircs abmad. The reference to the “career‘’ in 79, may, or may
not, be taken liiemlly, hut the tone of bitterness and self-condemnation is clear and undeniable.
ln some parts it is incohereut2 and this is due, as is liinted in the dedication to Scot, to the
licat and mental confusion under which it was composed. ln many passages the reader is
reminded of Jolmson's

⁴· Slow risos worth by poverty depressed‚''

and also os that great writer's couplet, recited in tears by its noble author in later yearS.
οι memorius of the past,

¹* Ther„¹ mark what ills the scholar’s life assail;
Toil. cnvy. want, the patron, and the-jail ”.

lt is pleasant to find the constant friendship of Scot sor l'lls weak and erring friend. The
concluding lines cannot fail to recall the opening lines os the Trwcllcm and how, as Leech by
“the wandcrmg Moselle* turm-d to Seot, so Gom-§miili ‘¹ unsriended'' by “the wandering
l’o'’ turned snndly in all llis wanderingz to his brother, the Rev. Henry Goldsmith‚ and
¹⁴ dmggcd at caeli remove a lengtliening chain ”. In several passages Leech, through genuine
feeling, or native ability, reaches a much liigher level man is shown by the colder and more
{inished style os Arthur Johnsion.
