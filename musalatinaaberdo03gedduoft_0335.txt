ARGUMENT-

Mark the trec-grown birds, Nature's misaele, with their Scottish name os minse.
Silvanus is their sire, and bluc Tethys their dam, where the Bear whctls round the
Pole. 'she sect] os the trees falls in drops into the sea, and friendly ocean receives
it, till, first a worm and then a true bird, it flies away and quitting the wate—rs skims
through the air. Let all the racc of birds yield to the Caledoniam oney sor this has
its origin from great Gods.

xxm. ANSERES DENDROPHYTAE, ALIAS VULGO
ι«ΕΙΑΞΚΕΕΙΨ (1623).

Aspice dendrophytas, naturae mira, volucres,
Anseris his Scoto nomina facta solo.
Silvanus pater est, ‘genetrix dea caerula Tethys,
Hae ubi finitimum circuit ursa polum.
5 Decidit arboreum stillatque in marmora semen,
Quod capit et gremio Tethys amica fovet :
Dum primo veluti vermis, mox vera volucris,
Evolet et linquens aera tranet aquas.
Cede Caledoniae volucrum genus omne volucri,
10 Nam genus a magnis haec habet una deis.

Leeeh also (Book iv. p. 68, 1623) has lines to the Solan Goose at the Bass Rock and
Ailsa Craig.

XXIV. ΟΝ SIR ROBERT AYTON, POET OF THE GREATEST
DISTINCTION.

Ayton's Latin Poems are in the Delitiac Poet. Scot. i. 40-75, and they are of excellent
quality. He was the second son of Ayton of Kinaldie in Fise, and was born in 157o; M.A.
St. Andrews; gentleman of the Bed Chamber. He was intimate with Ben Jonson and
Drumrnond of Hawthornden. Monument in westminster Abbey, erected by his nephew, Sir
John Ayton, which says he died at whitehall, March, 1638, aged 68. His success in English
verse was equally remarkable, and he was considered the first native of North Britain who
attained to a correct English style. Dryden said Ayton wrote “Some os the best verses of
that age''. His lines “1 loved thee once, I'll love no more,’' ⁴· I do consess thou'rt smooth
and sair,'' ‹,uite anticipate the style and manner of the Cavalier Poets. He is the first writer
of“ Old Long Syne‚'' refurbished by Allan Ramsay, till it reached Burns.

‘⁸ Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never thought upon . . .
To pity, if thou canst not love,
For old long syne.''

Burns almost certainly drew from this the last verse of Mary Morison.
