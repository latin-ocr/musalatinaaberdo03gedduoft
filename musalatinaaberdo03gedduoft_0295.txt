Great man! he who will supply your exchange will bc like Uzza, struck down.

'srust me, he who will take your place will labour in vain, and be a cackling goose,
Bear on your own shoulders the mighty orb and mass ol* labour; no one clearly is
equal to you. But that in this business Elisha may not be wanting, grant me with
the mantle os Elijah the power of speaking. Grant me, in your harvest time,
humbly in body and mind, to follow the footsteps os the kindly noaz to elcan aster
you.

Dum Cathedram Pastoralem mihi primum Obtulisset.

Qui vestras (Vir Magne) vices supplebit, is Uzzae
Desuper immisso fulmine pressus erit3
Crede mihi qui te referet, molimine vano
Rern geret; et populo dum strepet, Anser erit ;
5 Orbem humeris tute ipse tuis molemque laboris
Sustine, nam tanto par tibi nemo patet;
Ne tamen officio hoc Elisaeus desit, Eliae
Da mihi sub sacro tegmine posse loqui ;
Da vestra sub messe, 13an vestigia blandi
10 Mente humili et flexo poplite posse sequi.

Vl. TO HIS MOST ACCOMPLISHED AND BELOVED
FRIEND. GEORGE ANDERSON, OF SCOTLAND, HIS
OLD PHILOSOPHICAL PUPIL.

A pleasant university link between the Sub-Principal and the Magistrand, who had written
to his old teacher when in prison, and offered the means of release. Leech could remember at
the time the nature of the thesis—In quo Subsistat Itonos—by which Anderson took the degree
of Μ,Α. in King's College, in 1628 (see King‘s Call. Off. (md Grati. p. 184). Anderson died
before May 15, 1683. when his son was served heir; he was minister of Halkirk, in the Presby-
tery of Caithness (Hew Scott, Fasti, s.v. Halkirk).
