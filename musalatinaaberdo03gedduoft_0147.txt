lv,

John Rough and Thomas william& both chaplains to Juines Ilainilton,
Govcrnor os Scotland, both exiles for Christ: the soriner also a martyr
in England, at London, Dec. 22, 1557.
After the reviving glory ot* Christ is erushed by the wavering regent, we bowed
to the storm against our will. The court, which had enrolled us, sailed us: and with

it scll our hopes. Christ was an exile; can it be our shxune? 11‘ <tenth is to he

faced, the better part would be our Crown.
V.
George Wishart, or XVimheart, martyr, St. Andrews, March 1y 1540.

How happily the name suits the divine purpose!

He was the *heart ‘ and
the eye os‘wisdorn '. liis one love was Christ.

Suiting the present tv» the past,
and soreseeing the future, he soretells his own death and that oszirdinal Beaton.

He stood unappalled at the fire3 it fell, :50 as to seize on scw thereafter.
VI.
John Wedderburn, banished 1546. Died an exile in linglanrh 1556.
No merit in us to give you (lue thanks. Your actions and writings :ire such
that nothing can be purer. Hence no one is more hated os the enemy, and no one

deserved to be dearer to good nien, Yours is a greater inerim you consess you have
none, and that there is no place sor human inerit.

<2-)
On the Brothers John, james, and Robert Wedderburn.
Poets sing of a world ‹livided between the three brothers, Pluto, Neptune,
Jupiter. I rather wonder at you three, brothers, equal in love and in piety. Ilappy

were your parents, and happy the Dundee that bore you: its name fittingly is
Donum Dei.

VII,
John Κηοκ, the first restorer of the Gospel in Scodand, after the former
tirnes of blood, died peacefully at Edinburgh, Nov. 24, at eleven o'elock
at night, 1572.

This is Knox, the old-time Apostle of the Scots, as the great sseza styled hirn.
The interpreter of heaven, he gave many signs of his knowledge of the future. The
care of heaven, the goal of man's rage; the greater the victor, the greater the ruge.
Calumny at last has learned this, not even to believe itself. The piety os heroes is
hated of man. This trait alone is a proof of the hero's divinity.

VIII.
John Winock, died in England.

After enriching the cities of my country with celestial gifts, so that it can be a
light to others, I quitted it cheerfully. 1 planted the seeds in a neighbouring coun-
try, and it gave me means and honour. England and Seotland both regard me as a
citizen. A third country, Heaven, remains.
