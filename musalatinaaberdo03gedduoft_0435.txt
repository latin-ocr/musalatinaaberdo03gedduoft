DAVID WEDDERBURN. 3 85

219. Cornua. For the hunting horus. see the hunting scene in Bride os Lammcrmonr: and
for Jmnes as a horseman, the inimitable chapter xxvii. ol The· Fortuna ο] Nigcl. The text is
modelled on Virg. Aen. iv. 131-59.

235. For the ideas here VVedderburn clearly draws on the brilliant passage in Buchanan's
Epithalamium, 1558, of Mary and the Dauphin: ¹⁴ Substitit hic Gothi suror,'' etc. Wedderburn
is pale by comparison.

236. eg.. the famous legend of the Hays os Luncarty (ΒιιεΙιαηαη, vi. 32), mythical
ancestors os the neighbouring Earls of Errol. As an Aberdonian, wedderbum would naturally
think of the Danes at Gamery and Cruden (Boece, History, lib. xi. s. 244; Collections of
Aberdcen and Banff, Spalding Club, p. 489 and p. 375; Pratt’s Buchan (1901), pp. 250, 251).

‘¹ The Dancs from the north renewed eight diverse battels upon the Scots, but the heaps
of their withered bones left in diverse corners of this Countrye. lyke the tale Cedars cut doune
in Mont Libanus, may shew what mighty 10suaes. destr03ing such sonnes of Anak, have
weyed this Kingdomes Scepter heirtofore '³ (Muses’ ll'ehomc, p. 137, at Perth).

237· The legend of the extirpation os the mets, by Kenneth Macalpine. See Nicholson's
Kellia Researchcs (1904).

240. ag„ the legendary foundation os Aberdeen, by King Gregory, about 877 (Col-
lections ofAberdcen and Bonff, p. 42).

250. Iolaus, son of Iphicles: restored to youth by Hebe.

253. Junonia Hebe: daughter oi Jupiter and Juno.

280. Poor shepherd of Cleonae, who entertained Hercules when about to kill the Nemean
lion (Virg. Georg. iii. 19).

281. lucri-mento. See Conington or Kennedy on Virg. Ecl. iv. 49.

282. Philemon, with his wife Baucis, entertained Jupiter (Ovid. Met. 8. 631).

290. The Burgh Records οἱ Scotland shew (Hurne Brown, Scotland in the Time of Quem
Mary) the lack of walls was due to the poverty of the towns and not to the Spartan valour of
the inhabitants. Sparta was unwalled.

293. Virgil, Aen. vii. ²95-

²95· The lines of Agricola. The national vaunt, all through the Muscs' Welcomc, is about
as baseless as the Augustan laureate's attack on the Parthians (Horace, Ode-s, i. 12, 53).

306. Is this the Authorised Version of 1611 ?

310. Haec retro Saecula. The belief is not general but special. ‘¹ It is certainly known
that a question much debated in the speculative world of England about 1628 was the question
whether there were signs of decay in Nature, whether the Present were necessarily inferior to
the Past. Bacon’s influence, opposed as it was to that abject reverence t'or antiquity which
had prevailed since the revival of Letters, had given an impulse to what was still perhaps the
heterodox sentiment, namely saith in the present and in the future.'' Masson‘s Globe Milton.
p. 461, on the discussion by Milton in the University Thesis, Naturam non pati Senium.
Johnson (Life of Milton) notes the belief, propagated in England by Dr. Goodman, Bishop of
Gloucester, in the Corruption ⁰f Nature proved by Natural chson (1616). For the whole
question, much debated in foreign academies, and the 1627 refutation of it in Hakewill's
Apology, see Hallam, Litcrature, ch. xxvi. sect. ἰν. 46. The belief in Scotland, about the
sun sinking. and the steady decay of Nature, is handled by Buckle, Civilisation in England, iii.
p. 235, ed. Grant Richards, 1904.
