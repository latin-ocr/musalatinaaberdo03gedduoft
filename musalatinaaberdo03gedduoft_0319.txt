ARGUMENT.

Worth of the Collaces, renowncd in years and decds of men famed in VVar and
Law, and Home, assailed with many a sall yet daring to outlive tho wintry blast of
three hundred years—from which came my grandsire, my mother, my guardian,
where first I set my childish feet—graciously farewell together, and bc mindsul of
your Poet, who ever must be mindl'ul of you. But is the laurel I seek waits mc,
glory through me waits you.

XIII. BALNAMONIO DISCEDENS, KAL. MAHS, 1617.

Clara annis meritisque virum, Colessia virtus,
Quos hine Bellipotens vindicat, inde Themis,
Et domus, O, multis quanquam tentata ruinis,
Ausa tamen centurn ter superare hiemes.
5 Unde avus, unde mihi genitrix, tutorque suerunt,
Fas mihi ubi primas gramine ferre pedes ;
Dulce valete simul, memoresque estote poetae,
Qui nunquam vestri non potis esse memor.
Quod si me Clariis laurus quaesita tropaeis,
10 Vos manet ingenio gloria parta meo.

9-10. Cf. Axthur Johnston on Kintore (Musa, ii. 282) :—
“ Carmine Maeonio veteres tollantur Athenae,
Urbs haec versiculis est celebranda meis ” ;

“ Clara Maroneis evasit Mantua cunis,
Me mea natalis nobilitabit humus.''
