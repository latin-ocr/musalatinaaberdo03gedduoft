JOHN ΚΕΗ. 201

In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae
Lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet,
Semper honos, nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.
290 Eia alacres hilaresque virum tollamus in astra,
Cui Deus incoctum generoso pectus honesto
Imlidit, et quem ardens evexit ad aethera virtus.
O bone Fraseri, pietate insignis aviti,
Di tibi divitias tribuerunt, Ι)ἰ tibi mentem
295 Munificam‚ proprios sapiens qui didis in usus
A te divitiis uti iam discat avarus,
Qui loculis inhiat, congesto gaudet et auro,
Optime Fraseri, generose ac inclyte factis,
Quique modum rebus, certos et ponere fines,
300 Congruus ac almae Naturae vivere nosti,
Vive, vale felix, cuncta et tibi prospera vertant.

Fraser, os generous mind and glorious, tor), for thy actionsy

'sake the slight gifts that here, nymphs of the Don, we would brings
&light are the gifts in truth, nor such as can fitly reward thee,

Still7 if our off’ring is scant, lowly are we too that sing.

Thine is the silves and thine the store of the gold that is yellow,
Blessing both us in the gift, thee too the source whence it flmvs:
We can but bring thee our gifts that grow in our garden. the Muses,
Flowers that are purple and bright, lilies to blend with the rosc.

An eager joyous strain for him we crave
Thac reared again our grove and stately pile.
Long had the Muses in their halls that brave
The wind and weather worn a gracious smile.
Halls that our Elphinstone⁷ from taint of guile
Free and of stainless soul, had reared and long
Had borne the royal name, wherein the while
The youth for ages had been wont to throng.

To turn their studious feet and saise the grateful song,
