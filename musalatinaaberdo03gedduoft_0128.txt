Forgue, 1045 (Hew Scott‚ F. E S. iii. 655). l-'ather of Dr. james Garden, Prof. os Divinity‚
Kinglz eollegc, 1651-97. He has been confused with Alexander Garden, who wrote the

polished and persected by Mr. Alexander Gardyne. Edunt). Thomas Finlason, 1609.

David ming thinks the Regem may have been the son os the author, who was born about
1585 or 159‹1.was MA. before 1609v :ind was an advocate in Aberdeem possibly connected
with the (iardens of Banehory. See, for the question os confusion, the presace. p. xvii„ os the
(iareim in the Abbotssord Club edition, ¹⁸45· where the editor remarks that ‘⁴ sor harbarity os
style and pedantic simile, they stand unrivalled. Their only parallels are the punctuation
and orthography, which seem adapted sor the poenis and the poems sor thern. Could it have
been possible in rernm natum to have made them worse ? ”
