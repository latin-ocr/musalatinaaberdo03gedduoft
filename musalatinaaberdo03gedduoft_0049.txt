ElysiaS, moriarque libens, modo carmina nostro
Inscribat tumulo Rhaedus!

ARGUMENT.

As a rule scarcely one or two of the countless friends os this age think on an
absent friend. So rare a thing is love. Not only do you think on an absent friend,
and not only do you bewail your friend's death, but you give your friend life by
your tears. Stmchan, Seton has blessed you, by whose death you shall be styled
learned; Strachany you have blessed seton, to whom in death you have granted life.

To THE ΞΑΜΕ,

Strachan, I should not shun that day so drear to all, could 1 swim at death in
your tears.
