XII. DIRGE FOR PATRICK FORBES OF CORSE.

The θρῆνος ἐπιτυμβίδιος of NVedderburn, as a contribution to the overdrawn eulogy οι
Forbes in the 1635 szcrals. It no doubt represents fairly enough the party view, but the
inaccuraey in the opening line is very strikingv and shows how much or how little the Rector
of the Grammar School in New Aberdeen knew of the buildings in Old Aberdeen.

ΑκουΜῐῑΝτ.

In yon grave lies Bishop Forbes, in this ashes of Elphinstone and of Dunbar.
These were born when living virtue fimitis-hed, our harsher age produced Forbes as
a father. Iron age, indeed; but worthy was he osa happier tirne and worthy of the
sacred seat. By his <livine eloquence he rccalled the holders os the five Patri-
archatcs. His mind was equa! to his eloquence, a mind set on heavenly hopes,
and brighter than the starry world, suri-eying all the memorials of the older Fathcrs
in his new explanation os the Apoculypse. A Cato in gravity‚ a Caesar in the fray,
a justinian in the council. A inan os matured action, wise through practice, genius,
and dcsccnt. All the praise that the four-square perfect man has is entirely pro-
vided by the apostolic grave (or chair ?).

XII. PATRICII FORBESII A CORSE EPITYMBIDION.
[rosbes‘ Funerazs, 1635.]

Forbesius Praesul tumulo requiescit in isto,
Hie Elphinstonii Dumbariique einis.
lli nati viguit quondam cum vivida virtus;
Saecula Forbesiuin nostra dedere patrem.
5 Ferrea saecla quidem; dignus melioribus annis
Ille tamen, cathedrae dignus honore sacrae.
Quos Patriarcharuin sacra quinque sedilia mystas
Cepere, hos dio rettulit eloquio.
Par mens eloquio: mens spem super aethera librans3
10 Mens pia, sidereo purior orbe nitens:
Omnia mens lustrans patruni monumenta priorum,
Lumine dum reserat Pathmia fata novo.
Ut gravitate Cato, nitidis ita Caesar in armis,
Ius ita dicturis Iustinianus erat.
15 Mature meditata diu peragebat; ab arte,
A genio, a proavum nobilitate sagax.
Denique quod quadrati hominis laus dictitat, omne
Omne id apostolicus suggerit iste torus
Posuit David W'edderbumus,
Latinae Scholae in urbe Nova Abredoniae Praefectus
