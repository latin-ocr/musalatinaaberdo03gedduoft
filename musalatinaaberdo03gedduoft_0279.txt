(iortlon, Samis xlsjiiirs, ii. 155457, etl. 1841, writes: ‘⁵ After tlie reformatione ol'
the relligione, the then members ofthe universityc beganne to think upon a new niodell
ot' the institution of the L'niversitye3 to which pourpose one Mr. David Hanc, ther
principeH, (lrew a draught of a foundation, wherin all the old institution was turml
np syde downe. This they presented to James the Sixth, then king os Scottlande:
and it went neer to be ratifyd in parliament, had it not been opposed by seeretair
Elphinstoune, a great statesman, who, in t‘avours ot bishopp william Elphinstouns
memoryc (both of them being cadetts of the familye of Shelms), suitl it was no
reason lor to pervert the founders meaning, as t'arr as it could stand with tlie
resormed relligione. So the new ‹lrauglit was stisted in the birth3 and that pape-1·
coming afterwards into tlie hands os bishopp Patrieke Forbesse, with a sollicitatiom·
sor him to sett it anew on foote, he threw it into the syre, wher it en<led; and in-
stantly, being chancellor os the Universitye, caused sett the old institution on stmtc,
as sar as it could subsist with the protestant relligione: The two professiones of the
civil and Canon lawe he united into one, or rather commanded the civill law to be
taught in place of the other.

“The rentes that belonged to several professors, by the avarice of such as had
been members of the Universstye, were sewed or lett out for payment of so little as
could not maintaine tliem, and ther verye dwelling houses impropriat3 which, being
thus squandard, bishopp Forbesse could hardly recovcr all his lyfe tyme, and was
forced, as Ι have already tould, for to sett up the professione [the chair] of tlieologye
by waye of contributione: So farr was it from truthe that he had either oppresse-d
them or misapplyd thes rents, their having not been so much left undilapidate at
his entrye asto maintain all the professors according to their institutione.’'

Compare Ker's Danaides (sm). Patrick Forbes was felix opportunitate mortis,
dying in 1635 before the collapse os the system, reared by James Vl. and Archbishop
Spottiswoode, at tlie great Glasgow Assembly, 21st November, 1638 (Hunie Brovvn,
History, ii. 306-308).
