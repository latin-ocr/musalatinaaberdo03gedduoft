40 MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSIS.

Dempster. the total antithesis to the type os his race and city, the Catholic and wanderer,
presents a curious contrast to the Protestant teaehers of his time: Duncan Liddel, Gilbert
Jack, Walter Donaldson, Arthur Johnston, Thomas Reid. Yet in all liis career he never
forgot the city and the friends os his youth. He was a Humanist, but born out os the proper
century.

an autogr-aph letter os Henry Fut-Simon (prefixed to a copy of the Hist. Eccl. Gentis Scotorum,

Ι. FUNERAL LAMENT 1³OR THOMAS CRAIG, A POET OF
THE HIGHEST RANK AND A NOTED JURIST, AD-
VOCA'slv: IN THE SUPREME COURT OF SCOTLAND,
TO 511< LEWIS CRAIG, HIS SON, AND JUDGE IN
THE §AME COURT 01³ JUSTICF..

Thomas Craig, son οἱ Rohert Craig. merchant in lidinburgh, was osAberdeen descent‚
connected with the family os Craig. Fintray or Craigston, in the county of Aberdeen, from
which came the reformes, John Craig. Born about 1538, he was educated at St. Leonard's
College. St. Andrews. and studim] lau· in Franco. For lorty years he enjoyed a great practice
at the bar, being church counsel sor the Presbyterian party. IIe preferred the bar to the
bench. *⁸ Craig appears to have been a man os a modest and retiring disposition, devoted to
his profession, and fond os that relaxatio'n from the severer labours os the bar, which is to be
sound in a taste for classica) literature. His name is never connected with the politica] com-
motions which the money and intrigues ol England had kindled in the beart os our natnon ''
(Tytler, Ass—oum os Sir Thomas Craig. Edinb.. 1823). Dcmpster (Historia Εἰσὶ. Gcnt. Scot.
p. 197) describes him as “alter Maecenas, cuin summa posset capessere, mediocribus fuit
contentus. ct advocationis munus quum sustinuit tuin meruit submisse ’“. His second wife was
a relative of Buchanan's inothcr,Agnes Heriot. His son, Sir Len-is Craig, raised in 1605 to
the bench as Lord Wrightslands, died in 1622. Craig, who died on February 26, 1608, has lest
some poenis in ihc· Delitias Pastorum scotorum, i. 221-267, but his reputation rests on his great
contributions to feudal and Scottish law.
