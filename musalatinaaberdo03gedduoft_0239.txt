75 Alma dolens Matcm maerentia limina servant,
Horrendum! malesuada Fames et turpis Egestas
Respiciunt tandem miseras pia numina Musas:
Qui lovis irnperio Scotis sua iura ministrat,
Largus opum nobis Iacobus nomine sextus
So De locuplete penu fundit sua munera, terris
Nos variis donans, variis proventibus augens,
Hic, Mctclanc, tuurn nomen super astra feremus,
Hicque tuum Arbutlznote, tuum et divine Stnarte.
Nec tamen hisce frui licuit per nomina foeda,
85 Harpyias avidas: quae rapta cibaria nobis
Unguibus, ah: uncis lacerabant omnia dirae.
Donec Patricius clarus Forbesius ille,
Corsias, a fundis nomen sortitus avitis,
Unus qui nobis collapsam restituit rem,
90 Omnibus exhaustas prope cladibus, omniurn egenas
Nos miseras, humiles, penitus penitusque iacentes
Erexit; calidoque sinu complexus hic Almam

82. Robert Maitiand, Dean os Aberdeen‚judge in Court of Sessi0n3 formerly regent in
College: “the same who resigned the Deanery in favour of the College, at the Reformation ”
(orem). Cf. Lundie's Oratio Eucharistica cl Encomz'astica, 1631. For Principal Alexander
Arbuthnot (1569-1583) see M‘Crie's Andrew Mclvillc, pp. 355, 307. NValter Stewart, Principal
(1583-1592)‚ died at 36.

85. The careless and long administration of Principal David Rast, 1592-1632‚ the first
doctor of Divinity aster the Reformation. Revenues and {eus were alienated. “ Rhaetus hic,
literarum quidem studiis haud spernendus; alias autem non bene audit. Hic ad rem suam
nimis attentus, in re communi Coll. Regii procuranda parum fidus perhibetur ” (Kcr).

87. P-itrick ForbeS‚ Chaneellor and Bishop of Aberdeen, 1618-35. For this absurdly over-
estimated and merely astute person, see the Ριιηειάἶς, printed by Edward Raban in 1635, and
re-edited with much valuable matter in 1845 by charles Farquliar Shand, for the Spottiswoode
Club, Edinb. Dr. Walker, Historical Nous, p. 26, acutely hints: “Like Elphinstone, he
strove to make the University a School of Theobgy, but only through the severe discipline of
secular study. But times were changed, and questions, upon which even Patrick Forbes
could not get parties to agree, had now come to the front. . . . To the efforts of Bishop
Patrick Forbes King's College owed the foundation (1620) os the Chair os Divinsty, now
Systematie Theology.“ For his settling of Edward Raban, the winter, in Aberdeen, and his
repairs os [lie College fabric, see p. 27.
