15 Sat mihi, decrepito quod restituatur in aevo
Iosephus, senii verna iuventa mei:
Sospite sic Nato, Pater ind& renascitur: Ibo,
Solamen senii dulce videbo mci.
Divitiis titulisque tuis tute utere: amoris
20 Vincla tui tandem robore rupta iacent.

Aliud Eidem.

In quonam subsistat honos (ine I'raesirle quondam)
Ingenio fuerat quaestio mota tuo.
Dogmata clim Sophiae dederam tibi prima (Magistro
Me tibi) in hoc inentis forsitan error erat;

Insit honorato verius omnis honos;
Praebita qued nostra suerat t1bi Laurea (lextra,

calls him. There rs ‘¹ An Inquiry into the Life, Wrstings, and Character of Dr. William Guild,
with Strictures on Spalding’s account of Guild and his Times’' (Abdn. 1799, by >hirrefs).
Spalding's account (G. M. Fraser's Hislnrical Aberdcen, 1905, pp. 97, 98) is too often coloured
by personal dislike.

“The benevolenee of his disposition, and his benefactions to the 'stades of Aberdeen have
