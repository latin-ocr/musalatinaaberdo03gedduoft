ROBERT GORDON, OF STRALOCH.

This well-known antiquary and geographer was born on Sept. 14, 1580. and was the
second son os Sir John Gordon of I‘itlurg. He was educated probably at the Grammar
School os Aberdeen, and subsequently at the newly-sounded Marischal College, os which he
is said to have been the first graduate (Maidment's Cat. p. 119; Fasti Acad. Mar. ii. 185,
with pertrait). This would be in 1597, and in 1598 he proceeded to Paris to complete his
studies, a step the more to be noted from the fact that the l’rotestant feeling in Scotland had
greatly weakeried the attraction of the Scot Abroad to that seat os learning (Hume Brown's
Buchanan, p. 232). He remained there till the death of his father in 1600, and on Oct. 31 of
that year he was returned heir. He married. in 1608, Catherine lrvine, daughter ol Alexander
Irvine os Lenturk, the oldest cadet of the house os Irvine of Drum, and settled down to the study
of provincial history and geography. On Oct. 8, 1641, charles 1., at the request of the Bleau
firm at Ainsterdam, commanded his services sor the completion and correction os the Atlas ol*
Scotland which that house was preparing. He consented. and his letter of dedication is dated
Aberdeen, Jan. ²4· 1648. addressed to Sir John Scot os Scotstarvet, who promoted the issue of
the work as he had before borne the expense of the Delitiac Poetarum Scotorum. In 1655 he
wrote a presace intended to accompany a new edition os Spottiswoode’s History, and a
History afthc Family os Gordon. He died on Sunday, at midnight, Aug. 18. 1661, in the
8ist year os his age, and was buried on Sept. 6 in the churchyard of New Machar. During
the preparation os liis great work, the Theatrum scotiae. though the times were critical and
disturbed, he was protected by a special Act os Parliament in his favour, by which he was
released from all taxation and levies, and discharged from military exactions and quarterings.
This recognition of scientitic research recalls the notable French decree in favour os Captain
Cook. by which that explorer was to be left undisturbed by Freneh men-of-war in all waters,
though there was war at the time between the countries.

joseph Robertson (Βίας, Abrcrl. 11, 248) has extracted the following passages srorn James
Man's Introduction to Scaeish Mcmoirs :—

1. &Vritings in Theatrum Scotiac.

¹¹ But to come directly to Straloch’s writings. The Theatrum Scotinc in Bleau‘s Atlas
(Fol. Amst. 1662) was mostly compiled by him, who had frorn his younger years applied
himself to the study of geography. . . . After Pont's death his maps and papers were sent to
Straloch; who with his son James surveyed several parts os the nation not meddled with
before. . . . There are not so many os them of Straloch's own compos-ure as could be wished:
he having been a good while incapacitated sor the due carrying on os his undertaking by the
iniquity os the times and os his own circumstances ofwhich he gives the following enumeration
in his dedication os the Atlas to Sir John Scot of Scotstmvat, dated at Aberdeen 24 January,
1648. . . . Upon these accounts he devolved his undertaking on David Buchanan‚who had
revise-d a good ‹leal οί the first projected draughts; but his Life ended before the Troubles.
