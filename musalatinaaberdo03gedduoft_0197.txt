szw.

7. For the wall, see Tytler, i. 109.
10. Hectorinum. Not Danish, as in the verse translation, but referring to the Romans.

Trojan descendants os Hector.

Beside 'l'ay’s crystal stream and pleasant groves,
l'erth in its country’s heart is nobly plac'd.
High sov’reigns chose it sor their lov'd abodes,

By situation and rich produce grac’d.
The neighbour places law from it receive,

Their greatest honour to obey its will,
Alike its glory such just laws to give,

Their glory such injunctions to fulfil.
This only Scottish city walls surround

To guard it from the rash invader's spoil:
Its valour and its just reward have found

The Cimbrian, Saxon, and the Danish toil.
O blest with modern and with old renown,
Bcar thine old fame to future ages down.

CELURCA, OR MONS RosARUM.
See the lines by John Leech below, on his native city, addressed to Andrew Melville, and
his In Cclurcam for the name of Montrose.
Aureolis urbs picta rosis: mons molliter urbi
Imminet, hinc urbi nomina faeta canunt:
At veteres perhibent quondam dixisse Celurcam,
Nomine sic prisco et nobilitata novo est.
5 Et prisca atque nova insignis virtute, virumque
Ingeniis, Patriae qui peperere decus.

MONTROSE.

The city, sprinkled with the golden rose,
Commanded by a gently rising hill,

Of old Celurca, call’d, as some suppose3
Old and new name her glory¹s measure fill.

Alike she boasts of valour old and neW,
And names renown'd their country⁷s honour shew.

ABERDONIA.

Johnston's tribute to his native city. The praise of the climate has not been endorsed by
strangers generally. The ¹ morum cultus ³ was noted by them as a feature. See Book os Bon-
Accord for “ gallamrie, breeding, and civill conversatione '⁸ (James Gordon, 1660), p. 20.

Ad Boream porrecta, iugis obsessa superbis,
Inter connatas eminet una Deas.
