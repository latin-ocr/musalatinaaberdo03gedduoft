INTRODUCTION. xvii

Frederick 1. os Denmark, gives the following account of him: “ In the year 1520,
on the eve os St. james· Day, there died at Copenhagen os the plague :1 niun os
the highest character and most worthy through the whole os his long lise, >122-
gister Petrus de Scotia, a l)octor os Theology. 1⁴'0r he, when a public Arndt-my
was erected in that town, which had been in 1479 sanctioned by the Most 11111)-
Father, Sixtus 1V., at the request of Christian I.‚ carne from (Lologne‚ and hav-
ing been made the new Moderator and Regent of the new Academy, preside-(1
over it for sorty-two years. He was exceedingly learned in Scholastic 'l'heology,
and especially in the method os Thomas Aquinas, and was so devoted to the
Philosophy os Aristode, which was usually the mark οῖ’ the sollowers os Thomas,
that he neither learned nor taught any other philosophy, even when he reached
mature old age, for he had passed, unless I arn mistaken, his 70th year at the
time of his death. May God have mercy on his soul, for He dealt with hirn
during his life that he never coveted anything‚ content always with the scanty
income derived from his labours and studies, nor (lid he ever sall under the sus-
picion of any heretical opinions He was by precept and example the occasion
to many of living an honest life and a good pattern of life. In this our age,
there are many students of the old theology and the old learning, hut sew os these
are cultivators and imitators os the old piety, to the great loss of both piety and
learning. Some are averse to learning, because its lovers being devoid of piety
lead a life of license. Others calumniate piety as the mother of superstition.
Thus a pious erudition and an erudite piety are alilre wanting in all. Unlearned
rusticity‚ indeed, is less offensive than learned malice and perversity.

“So sar the old monk os whose rustic and sornewhat wordy style the above is a
literal version. Let us hope he possessed the piety which he valued above learn-
ing. Living at the time os the Reformation, which swept away the monasteries
in Denrnark, as in England and Scodand, his Chronicle, only saved from destruc-
tion by being hidden in the wall behind the altar os the Church of Skibby, utters
from its saded pages a wail not unnatural at the progress of the new Lutheran
doctrines, and the overturning of the old Church and the old Philosophy.

“ Arrild Hintfeldt in hisDanish chronicle, first printed in 1599, in his account
of the foundation os the University of Copenhagen, mentions that Christiern Ι.
called from Germany three learned men to inaugurate its studies, Peter the Scot‚
a Bachelor of Divinity: Peter Albrettson‚ a Licentiate in Law, and Tilemand
Slecht, a Licentiate in Arts‚ who were all promoted to the degree of Doctor at
the same time. The conferring of the degree on Peter the Scot is also chronicled
under the year 1498, when Thange was Dean of Copenhagen and vice-Chan-
cellor of the University. In noticing his death in 1520 he adds that he came

from Cologne and was one of the Masters of the Sorbonne.
