i. pp. 4, 5. The lines show the long incubation of the work, to which perhaps Arthur Johnston
refers in the opening lines of his Latin prose dedication, Prodeant tandem Poetae Scoti. ¹¹ I
infer that Scot had visited Holland before 1620. and that from about this time or at latest from
1627. he had the projection in his mind of a collective publication os recent Latin poetry'‘
(Masson's Drummond of Hamerndcn, p. 227, note). The collection represents the golden
age of Latin verse in Scotland. ‘¹ Unread now= alas! and utterly uncared sor, except per-
chance by some rare book-worm or zealot in Latinity here and there, those elaborately
conserved productions, the growth of hours ancl months of the linguistic skiss, and even. in
some cases, the 18111 thought and beart-throbbing. of men once alive as we are, but whose
dust lies longscattered and untraceable now 111 Scottish and foreign earth⁸⁷ (ibid. p. 249).
“ But perhaps the most extraordinary circumstance in the history of our literature at 11115
period is the enthusiasm with which Latin poetry was cultivated by our countryrnen. Divines,
lawyers, physieians, country gentlemen, courtiers, and statesrnen, devoted themselves to this
difficult species of composition, and contended with each other in the vari0us strains which the
ancient masters of Roman song had employed. The principal poems in the collection entitled
Delitine Poceammz Scotorum were originally published, or at least written, at this time. They
are of course possessed of very different degrees os merit, but of the collection in general we
may say that it 15 equal to any of the collections of the same kind which appeared 111 other
countries, except that which contains the Latin poems composed by natives os Italy. If this
was 1101 1118 classic age of Scotland, it was 31 least the age of classIcal literature in it ”
(M‘Crie's Mclville, p. 395). The Collection os Scots Poets issued in 1637 from the Amsterdam
press of Johdnn Blaeu had been preceded by the Dvlitiac Poetarum Italorum, Gruter, 2 vols„

ARGUMENT.

While Scot prepares the publication of the Scottish Sons of Song‚ collecting
their scattered remains from various quarters‚ the bees quitting their hive in wonted
style settled together where a scented laurel discloses its green foliage. Then in
a body again, it is a portent that l tell, the mass following their leader selected
a definite spot at the top of Seot’s house, where his library preserves the sacred
