Vl. TO ΤΗ E MEMORY AND GREAT PLACE OF GEORGE,
MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EARL MARISCHAL.

WEDDERBURN'S TRlEUTE TO THE FOUNDER OF MARISCHAL COLLEGE.

ARGUMENT.

Of old seven citios, equal in love, contenderi sor the birthplace of great Homer.
13ut,mighty Earl, in thejudgment ofjove, a greater quarrel has arisen over your grave.
Franco longs to associate herself with your brother, whose loss Geneva bewails and
Bcza immortaliscs in song. The Dane, ιο recall the royal bridal, would with a great
sum buy this stone, regardlcss of camus laid low. Germany attentively remembers
the old Catti who inhabitcd the depths of the Hcrcynian For-est. Greece beholds at
Abcrdecn Athens rex-ivm, the sacred walls of a new shrine of Athene, and claims
you l'or herself alone astho one pillar of the Muses: while mother Scotland rejoices
in your long ‹le-secut. Father Jove himself hesitated in doubt, as he marks the part
playcd by the Marischal,111c camp at Dupplin, the capture of Pcrth, the marks os
royal reiterated confrclcnee, the everlasting loyalty sor eight centuries, and the son
the house's hope, [hrough whom the race of Keith almost outdoes itself in rank.
Then they say hc quietly thus dccidcd the quarrel. ‘⁴ Let Heaven have his soul,
Dunnottnr his body, and the whole fabric os sky and land have his renown.'’
