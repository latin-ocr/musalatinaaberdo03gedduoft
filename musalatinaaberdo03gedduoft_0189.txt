For a slmilar series os descriptions of the towns of Scotland. by Arthur Johnston, see
Musa, ii. 2255-87v with the notesv and reference to the models supplied by Ausonius and J. C.
Scaliger. John Johnston’s version is much earlier than that os the Medicus Regius, who
closely in many places follows our writer. The text is taken from Camden's Britannia, in the
1789 edition os Gough, where the metrical version is appended. Dr. George Mackenzie in his
Livcs of Scottislz Wrifcrs also prints the Latin with a translation os his own. In the Latin
correspondence between Camden and Johnston, following the biographieal sketch. there will
be found a full account of the progress ol the Urbes. The small importance of Glasgow is
notexvorthy, as is also the inclusion of Inverlochy. Our author in some cases writes with-
out personal knowledge of the towns he describes. and Buchanan's History was clearly the
source of many os his ronches. Johnston's epigrams appear in the 1607 edition of Camden's
Britannia,- Philemon Holland in the 1610 edition has a version of his own. For the different

editions of Camden, see Chambers' (ξω-ἰοί). of Eng. Lit. i. pp. 268, 269, ed. 1901.
CARLEOLUM.

Romanis quondam statio tutissima signis,
Ultimaque Ausonidum meta labosque ducum,
E specula late vicinos prospicit agros,
Hinc ciet et pugnas, arcet et inde metus,
5 Gens acri ingenio, studiis asperrima belli,
Doctaque bellaci figere tela manu.
Scotorum reges quondam tenuere beati;
Nunc iterum priscis additur imperiis.
Quid, Romane, putas extrema hic limina mundi ?
10 Mundum retro alium surgere nonne vides?
Sit vidisse satis: docuit nam Scotica virtus
Immensis animis hic posuisse modum.
