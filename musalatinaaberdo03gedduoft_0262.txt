James Fraser. when fifteen, entered King's College in 1660: he was for three years under
Patrick Sandilands, the regent; he graduated on roth July, 1664, under Robert Forbes, the
last os the Canonists of King's College (Officers aad Gradnatcs of Univ. and King's Collega,
New Spald. Club, 1893, p. 30). After graduation, he proceeded to England. where he became
travelling tutor to several families of rank, visiting a large part os Europe in this way. He
was tutor to the Duke of St. Albans, and by Charles ll. was made first Secretary to Chelsea
Hospital, a post which he held sor sorty yearS. through the reigns os Charles 11., James 11., and
William and Anne. By James 11. he was created keeper os the Royal Library and Liecnser
of Printing. Much of his wealth was derived from his brother william. the Governor of
Forts St. David and St. George. in the Madras Presidency. He died in 1731, aged 86, and
was buried in the Church os St. Martin's in the Fields, on 22nd h‘lay. Ker gives 26th May as
the day of his death ; but the probate os his will is dated 24th May, 1731. As Ker states that
his death was on a Waimsday, it is possible that the true date may have been Wednesday,
19th May, the day on which a codici} to his will is dated.
