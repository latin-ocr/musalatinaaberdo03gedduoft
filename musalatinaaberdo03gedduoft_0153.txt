JOHN JOHNSTON. ιιι

5 Dira superstitio grassata tyrannide in omnes,
Omniaque involvens Cimmeriis tenebris.
Illa nequit lucem hanc sufferre. Ergo omnis in unam,
Fraude, odiis, furiis, turba cruenta coit.
Igne cremant. Vivus lucis qui fulserat igne,
10 Par erat ut moriens lumina ab igne daret.

11. IOANNES MACHABAEUS.

Alpinus. Christianismi in Dania Instaurator, Hasniae Theol. l’rosussom floruit 1550, teste
Balaeo.

Quae tulit in lucem me Scotia, luce frui me
Non tulit. Haud mirumst sprevit et ipsa Deum.
Anglia vix cepit. Subeuntem Teutonis oras

Suscipiens fovit L . . . onis in gremio.
5 Lutheri hic tetigisse datum dextramque Philippi :

Cernere et hic Christum lucidiore die.
Me doctore dehinc amplexa est Dania Christum;
Hafnia dat patriam, datque eadem tumulum.
Huc vitae cursus : supremi hic meta laboris.
10 Hinc vehor exilii liber in astra metu,
Haud iactura gravis, patria tellure carere,
In patria gravior posse carere Deo.

John Machabaeus retired to England, 1532, thence to Denmark, where Christian 111. made
him Professor of Divinity at copenhagen. Brother-in-law o( Miles Coverdale, translator os the
Bible. He was, as M‘Crie shows (Knox. p. 322) of the Clan Alpine. Irving (Scottisle Pocts,
ii. 87) thought his name was Macheth, as Macabaeus is the form of that king's name in Boece.
“ The form is due to Boece's accurate knowledge of the Celtic which slurs over th in the
pronunciation (Macbeathad), and bya parallel example the familiar usquehuc is phonetic sor
uisgebeatha (water oflife), in which last word th is not sounded '' (Sir W. Geddes, ‘¹ snakes-
peare and Hector Boece,’' Crown and Toum, 1896, p. 46).

5. He met Luther and Melanchthon at Wittenberg. He died at Copenhagen, aster six-
teen years there, December 6, 1557.

11. Contrast Scott's quotation of Sannazaro's lines (erroneously ascribed to Politian by
Lockhart, Life. ch. 83), “Grata quies patriae, etc.‚'' when huri-sing over the Alps to die at
Abbotsford.
