Ι. THE PERSON1F1CAT10N OF PATRICK FORBES OF
CORSE.

It is remarkable to find a very close parallel in expression to these lines in the hymn by
Sir John Bowring, 1³.R.s., Govt-rnor of Hong-Kong, who died at Exeter, 23rd Nov. 1872:
¹ ln the Cross of Christ l glor-ys As the tombstone os Forbes was supposed to show the
memorial, sothe first line os the hymn is inscribed on Bowring's.

ARGUMENT-

Let not my death triumph in ancestral titles, though it may lay claim to a long
and proud line. Let the vulgar, which has nothing more, derive solace hence; my
glory rests in the cross of our Lord. He made me a minister of the Cross, raised me
to the title os bishop, and set me over· the elergy. From the cross comes my honour,
the cross is the anehor of my saith, from the cross my house takes its name and
motto. The eross had been my stay, medicine in sickness, antidote against death,
my hope, my life, my salvation. Now my immortal part above the stars sings the
eross, and the quire os angels joins in my song. And while the tomb shall enelose
my body, it shall joyously celebrate the cros& so that a late race of descendants
may read this memorial on my bones.

l. l'ATRlCll FORBESII A CORSE PROSOPOPEIA.

[Forbes' Frena-mlx, 1635]

Nc mea maiorum titulis Libitina triumphet,
Attalicis quamvis annumeraret avos;

Hinc (eui nil superest) captet solatia vulgus,
Est posita in Domini gloria nostra cruce.

5 Me crucis instituit vatem, me praesulis auxit

Officio. vatum praeposuitque gregi.

A cruce noster honos, Fidei crux anchora nostrae,
A cruce nostra domus nomen et omen habet.
