WILLIAM WEDDERBURN.

erliam Wedderburn was the younger brother of the Rector, David, and entered Maris-
chal College in the year 1611-1612. He was a ¹¹doctor,‘' or under master in the Grammar
Schooh and sor an incident there see T. C. ch. of June 4, 1617 (Simpson's Bon-Rccord, pp.
50. 51). Promoted from the College Regency to Bethelnie (Mefflrum), from which he was
deposed: “accuisit of fornicatiouis. he confessis, deprivit and ordanit to make repentance¹’
(Spalding. ii. 136). This was in 1642, the sentence being taken off by the General Assembly
in August, 1643, when he was recommended for a place. He was admitted to Invernochtie
or Strathdon, October. 1651. He was apparently dead by April 19, 1660, when it was vacant
(see Hew Scott. Fasti, iii. 563. 592; Etclcs. Rccords osAbcrd. : spald. Club. Misccll. iii. 214).

The youngest brother was Alexander, who was elected to a Johnston bursary, “for the
quhilk the said ΜΓ. Alex. will endevor himselff in all tyme coming to kyth himself thankfull to
the town '¹ (Simpson‘s Bon-Record. p. 55: Τ. C. ch. Jan. 29, 1623; S. N. and Q. 2 v. 186;
Collections osAbcrd. and Banff, p. 64).

l. APOTHEOSIS ΟΡ GEORGE, MOST ILLUSTRIOUS
EARL MARISCHAL.

The founder of Max-ischal collegev George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal¹ needs no illustra-
tion (see Abcm'. Qnatcr. Studics, 5772: Fasti Acad. Mar. i. 1-88; ii. 3; Walker's Historical
Notcs (1906), pp. 20-24; Ogston's Oratio Funcbris, 1623). “He returned to his native
country, aster an absence of seven yearS. The Scottish peer who in the sixteenth century
founded a universim, and encouraged learning, must have been a man whose penetration and
grasp of rnind were very different from those of his colleagues in rank ” (Robert Chambers,
Biog. Dict. iii. pp. 293).

He was sent in July, 1589, an ambassatlor to Denmark, to complete the marriage of
james Vl. and Anne of Dennrark. ¹¹ His knowledge of foreign languages at once marked him
uut as the right man, while his great wealth was os first-rate importante, sor he made himself
responsible for the enormous expensos os the mission. By way of recompense, he got the
lands of the historic abbey of Decr. which were to play an important part in the endowment of
his univcrsity (Aln-rd. Quatcr. Studics, p. 61).

¹‘There is a curious, if unconscious, symbolism in Marischal street, for it leads to the
harbour and thence to the sea. and the sea has played a large part in the fortunes of the Keiths
and their munificence. . . . That same sea has borne the children of the College to every
corner of the world: and the dazzling white towcr which marks the fifth Earl's great founda—
tion stands to-day as one of the first landmarks for the wayfarer in our northern waters'’
(Abcrd. errcr. Studia, p. 63).
