Il. TEARS OF THE MUSES OF ABERDEEN ΟΝ THE
DEATH OF PATRICK FORBES, BISHOl' OF ABER-
DEEN, THEIR PATRON ΑΝΙ) THEIR PHOEBE&

ARGUMENT.

Lct us all that worship Apollo of Claros lanient, for our father Forbcs has fallen,
greater than Apollo, not to say the father of wisdom. who restored us when almost
dead, our own and country’s father. His death is to be lamented by all the just, hy
us more especially. Aias, now has fallen the bright bearn ol* the presbyterS, the
clergy's stay, the glory of the senate, light of the North, glory of Mar, ornament of
the Forbescs. His uprigfflness, holiness, and faithful discharge of duty cannot be
sufficicntly praised. What cannot be too much 01· sufficiently praised cannot be too
much or sufficiently lamented. Its sad memory but swells our grief. The remains
of that bright bearn forthwith allay our tears, and the bright virtues of his surviving
son do not allow the father to die. This is something, but it was more to sec him
even weak with age, yet strong in mind, shewing the way of wisdom. Ah, who can
make up our loss, how shall we lament him! Let our tears have no end. Our light
and stay has fallen. Sooner shall the earth be moved from its centre, sooner the
stars fall from heaven, than we shall cease to lament with tear-stained cheeks the
death of Forbes.

TUM PATRONI ET PHOEBI SUI, PATRICII FORBESII,
PRAESULIS ABREDONENSIS.

[Forbes’ Funera Is, 1635]

Plangamus Clarium quotquot Apollinem
Ardenter colimus, maior Apolline
Noster Forbesius nam pater occidit,

Ne dicam Sophiae parens.

5 Qui nos languidulas, et prope mortuas,
Claras omnigenis reddidit artibus.
plangamus lachrymis non mediocribus

Et nostrum et Patriae Patrem.
