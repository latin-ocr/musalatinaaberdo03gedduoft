cathedral city; and it had its universities, around which gathered a group of
scholars who were not all ecclesiastics. Many of them—such as the Johnstons,
the Forbeses, Baron, and others—had a reputation sor scholarship widely spread
over Europe. The commerce of the district had made it affluent for the period.
Many rich landed proprietors had their town residences there, and among these
was the Marquis of Huntly, the most powersul subject os Scotland. The map
shows the district to be naturally separate from the rest os Scotland‚ stretching
far eastward into the German Ocean. It had thus the means of uninterrupted
communication with the Europcan continent by scu. In the minds of the zealous
Protestants there were horrible suspicions as to tht· doctrina] poison thus brought
into the land, not only in the shapt- os l‘opish books and symbols os idolatry, but
of seminary priests and other zealots, who, on their arrival, were protected and en-
couraged in their devilish labours hy the pestilent l‘opish house os Huntly.

‘¹ The community of this district felt themselves strong enough to venture on
a policy of their own, and it was not that of the supplicants and the covenant.
Nor do they appear to have l‘avoured Laud's innovation. They desired to sec
things remaining as they were—the bishop with his limited powers, and the old

towards the west, Huntly had a following of a totally different origin.”

But it is no less true that the position os Forbes and the
Doctors rested on a basis that is seldom recognised. They had
been put by the Crown in possession of power, absolute power,
and sor a specific purpose.

“The Commissary Courts were suppressed: and the power of judging in
matrimonial and testamentary causes, and in all others of a mixed kind, was
transferred to the bishops in their several dioceses. Large sums of money were
expended by the king in buyiQy back the alienated episcopal lands and revenues,
that the hishops might live in a style suitalsse to their rank. Archbishop Spots-
wood was made an Extraordinary Lord of Session, to prepare the way sor the re-
storation os the episcopal order to the place which they had formerly held in that
court. But nothing contributed more to the advanccment ot* their designs than
