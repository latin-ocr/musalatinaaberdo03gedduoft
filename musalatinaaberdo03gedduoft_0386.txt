ΟΝ THE DEATH OF PATRICK FORBES OF CORSE.

ARGUMENT.

Does then that pious bislum, burning with holy zeal‚ and graced with every
accomplishment, the marrow of eloquencc and wisdom. the pricsthood's glor-y, the
gem of the royal senate, the lover of peace, the truest observet of law and justice,
the restorer of churches andos univcrsitics, aster quitting this mortal life, join the
heavenly quire, leaving the carth in tcars at bis death? But on earth his lise was
ever such that he seemed to find it outside in heaven, his true home. So in quitting
this world he enjoys his rest above, so as ever yet to survive by his writings, ancl his
true part knows not death. 'she same and the worth osso great a man will need no
pompous funeral. God grant one like him, for a greater we shall never enjoy.
