IV. ANDREAE MELVINO, SS. THEOLOGIAE IN AGADE-
MIA SEDANENSI PROFESSORI.

Iactet Edina suos, ‘saodunum et Glaseua vates,
Quaeque Caledonii nomine gaudet agri.

Sit sua Sterlino, sua sit quoque gloria Pertho,
Et decus Andreae constet honorque suus.

5 Tollat Aberbrothea caput, caput inde Brechinum,

Devaque qua videt, aut moenia Dona subit.

Dum vetus et ter pulsa loco Celurca priori
Nos Melvine duos non neget esse suos.

ARGUMENT.

Whether your name occurred in my first or fourth, οι· any other book of mine,
value that, Leslie, not a hair. But if, finding a place in my first book, you hear
yourself styled the last of my friends, and do not take the first rank, do not value
that slightly, but most deeply. Nay, unless you think I jest, rate yourself higher
than the whole.
