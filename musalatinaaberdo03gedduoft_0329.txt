JOHN LEECH. ⁹79

ARGUMENT.

Like the Danaides by the infernal streams filling their pitchers in vain, like
Sisyphus rolling his ever rebounding stone, and like sick Tantalus thirsty in mid
stream, such am 1, who ever strix-e to exalt your name, sair Delia. For where shall
my labour find beginning, middle, or end? What goal shall it reaeh, if you are all
in all to my mind and my constant theme? who can comprehend the infinite, who
assign a limit to the illimitable? If your praise and your worth and charming
grace surpass all limits, why shall 1 seek to pen you within the sinite or hope to sing
your name? Farewell, now, to cheeks of Paphian witehery and Phoebus' loeks,
eyes that rival the lights above, the thousand sseeting kisscs of rosy lips, and you
Cupid and your trainy the dauco, and my pleasing lute. Enough that my early
youth felt the glow‚ and often sighed over resigning the sportive lay, enough to have
spent watchful night with a flood of salt tears. How could 1 steer my blind bark
where Scylla's whirlpool boils and where the sirens with melting melodies charm
the soul but ill-defended by the artifice of Ulysses ? Better to have soared alost and
sung a strain to the golden lyre os Phoebus in a more serious mood, and in the corn>
pany of the great chiefs of song to have handled the mighty works os God, how the
omnipotent Father has from nothing framed the world we see, and enclosed an
immortal part of himself in our bodies. all which Du Bartas could write in his death—
less page, or by the rousing of the chiefs to defend Jerusalem I might sing os great
fights with the trump of Tasso, or what the sacred skill of Alexander has bequeathed
in native measures, the solemn judgment of God, when the world shall be utterly
consumed by heat. 1 should have derived thence the material of a noble strain and
fame. Α51115, Cupid had the first fruits of my muse and my youthsul days have
passed in sportive measures, for the censure of Momus and his disapproval of my 111-
timed lay. Yet have 1 no reason to be ashamed of following in Cupid's train.
What wrong is there to have deserved my mistress' favour and to have kept my
plighted word? What wrong in constancy? or in simplicity and truth? Resides
Nature gave my green youth over to my mistress and to your wileS‚ little Cupid.
Otherwise the race of man would perish. Flowers fit the spring, the ripe ears
summertide, fruit Autumn, and eold the VVinter. Love fits youth. Ι find no
pleasure in wrinkles ploughed on the brow of youth. Now, my lyre, I must resign
the dance and song, and sing of wars with the blast of the trumpet.

Qualis fumificas rapidi Phlegethontis ad undas,
Aut Acheronteos impia turba lacus
Doliolis iniectat aquas, neque dolia replet,
Semper enim infusae defluit humor aquae ;
5 Qualis et Aeolides saxum revolubile versat;
