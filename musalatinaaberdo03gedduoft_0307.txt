JOHN LEECH. 257

Ah, will no soule give ear unto my mone ,² mic.
Who answers thus so kindly when Ι crie? 1., etc., etc.

Liter. i. p. 278.

The issue os his book, as we have seen, is puzzling in the extreme. The 1620 edition of
the Musae Priores has no publisher's name (Londini‚ 1620). There are three distinct pagina-
tions in the book, which is 12mo. It actually includes (Epig. ii. 26; iii. 59) things headed in
1621. The preface to Pembroke says: “Tandem aliquando post triennalem peregrinationem
ad te, Nobilissime Herberte, hic meus iam postliminio redit partus. . . . Sume igitur„ habeque
nunc iterum, me meaque ”. From this we may infer that the first edition was printed or circu-
lated in 1617, The second editIOn of the Epigrams is mentioned and described in the book,
Epig. iv. p. 95. 'l'he third edition of the Epigrams alone—‘editio tertia prioribus multo
emendatior ’—w:1s issued as a small quarto in 1623 by B. Alsop, London. After 1626 we
entirely lose sight of Lcech. Possibly he died young. as he expected. All that he says about
calumnies cannot have weighed with his friends. To the last he was intimate with Drummond
of Hawfflornden, a highly fastidious person. As Ben Jonson said of himself, “Ayton (Sir
Robert) loved him dearly,'' and this friendship with Drummond has weight. In the 1637
Dclitiac Scot included his name and a piece by him in connection with his own lines, thus
clearly showing his mature and editorial opinion. At Court the running was all in favour of
Scottish favourites like Viscount Doncaster, and there was nothing sor Leech. Too much
may bc made of his mendicuncy. There is clearly an clement of bitterness and anxiety under-
lying a good deal os Arthur Johnston's verse, and his reputation has scarcely risen with the
judicious through his rather sulsome lines to the Scottish peers and the whole bench os bishops
(Musa, ii. pp. 97-113). Perhaps there is light on the subject to be found in Dr. Johnson's
words. A dedicator was not necessarily on oath. ‘¹ Ι believe,'’ he said, ‘¹ l have dzdicated to
all the Royal Family round, even music for the German flute, to Edward, Duke of Ycrk.'’
What the lexicographer could find in the subject to expatiate upon to the Hanoverian can be
imagined. *⁶ Literature,'¹ as Dr. Robert Wallace, M.P.‚ writes (Buslmnan, p. 34), “was not
yet a profession or ‘bread study‘. Shakespeare made his money less as a writer than as a
showman.'' It had been a tradition from the days of Erasmus, but what was possible for him
or for Buchanan to tell Mary and the Regent Moray, was not possible for John Leech in 1617-
20. “They,'' as the same writer says, p. 38, “had done a good work on the High Street of
the World. They had sung it a song or played it a melody such as it would hear nowhere
else. Were they not entitled to send round their hat among the listeners? '' Leech was, as he
confesses, “gloriae avidissimus''. But by that date the Latin imitator of the Roman elegiae
poets had little or no place in England, and none whatever in Scotland.

Pros. Edward Bensley, Aberystwith, draws my attention to the fact that Leech's Musae
Priores (1620) are frequently quoted by Burton in the Anatomy os Melancholy.

Ι. ΟΝ HIMSELF, ΟΝ FINISHING HIS COURSE IN PHILO-
SOPHY, 1614, IN KING’S COLLEGE, ABERDEEN.

The first appearance of Leech, in the 1610-14 Art class. An interesting thing, perhaps
the first authentie and veritable notice of the perennial Magistrand. Omniscient as a new-
fledged graduate, he begins to recog-nise, as he advances, his fragment of Nescience, called

Knowledge (Sartor Resartus).
