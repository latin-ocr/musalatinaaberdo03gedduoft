xxxii INTRODUCTION.

In preparing the work 1 have derived the greatest assistance
from a list of names and bibliographical references compiled in 1896
by Colonel William Johnston‚ C.B., of Newton Dee. My best
thanks are given to the Rector of the Grammar School, Mr.
H. F. Morland Simpson, M.A., who has read with rne through the
press the whole of the book with as much care and accuracy as is
it had been his own. For any expression of opinions throughout
the work he is not in any way responsible : all such are purely my
own, but his interest in the task of proof-revision deserves the
heartiest recognition, none the less expected, perhaps, from one
who on all occasions where Al-›erdeen is concerned has shewn
himself the genuine successor os her Cargills and wedderburns,
and. though a stranger to her by birth, to be in all essentials Aber-
domtusz'lms ipsl's :Ilwrdoucnsz'or.

To Mr. Kellns Johnstone and to Mr. l‘. J. Anderson it is
necessary to refer only in a word. They have so made their
own the subjects of Aberdeen Bibliography and the Aberdeen
Graduatc. that all who (lenl with these topics find it alike a pleasure
nnd a duty to ncknowledge a debt to their work. The Carlylean
demand sor a copious Index is sully met by the very caresul and
complete work of Miss Jenn E. lx'ennedy. ⁴
