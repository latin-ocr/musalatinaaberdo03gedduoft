Dum totam erraret forte incomitata per urbem
Virtus, nec laudum praemia iuncta forent,
Hospitium multos ct supplex saepe rogavit;
Qui daret hospitium non tamen ullus erat.
5 Adfuit haud multo post laus, (res mira) repente
Laudis in amplexus urbs furibunda ruit.
Non secus illa tamen quam dudum exclusa manebat.
Atque iterum in solum est ire coacta nemuS.
Verum ubi Laus dominam Virtutem sensit abesse,
ιο Ad dominam ingrata rursus ab urbe venit.
Utraque post rediens Bonvisi tendit ad aedes:
Hic Virtus, pulsa Laude, recepta suit.
Nam fraudem ille timens blanda sub fronte, recede
Laus (ait) hinc, studiis insidiosa bonis.
