JOHN FoRssEs.

John Forbes, second son os Bishop Patrick Forbes, was born May 2, 1593. and educated
at King's College. He studied abroad 31 Heidelberg, where he matriculated on May 24, 1613
(Aberd. Quaterrsnt. Rccord (1907), p. 434), and at Sedan. Returning to Aberdeen he was
appointed in 1619, in his twenty-sixth year, first Professor os Divinity (King's Call. Off. and
Grad. p. 68 ; theses in the A beni. Θυσίων. Studia, Bibliog. p. 390). He was Recto: osthe College
in 1634 31111 1635 (Ru-toria! :hulmum (1902), pp. 330, 331) and contributed to the 1635 Funcrals
of his father. His position in the case os the ‘Aberdeen Doctors’ and his debates with the
representatives os the Assembly arc well known from the historians os the time, and should be
read in Spalding, who is not to be trusted implicitly (see Bibliography, u.s. p. 400). The
defeat of his own and late sathcr's party at the Glasgow Assembly os 1638 led to his ssight,
depr-{vatiom and exile (Spalding. ii. ’.ξομ Shand's Funcrals, pp. 6-9). He sailed sor Holland
on April 5, 1644, returned in 1646 and retired to Corse where he died on April ²9· 1648, 111 the
fifty-fifth year 01 his age. I‘le is buried in the churchyard of Leochel,

His chier work is the Instructioncs Historico-Theologicac (Amsterdam, 1645), “A well-
known book os John Forbes of Corse. repeatedly issued on the Continent, is eulogised by
Baur as one of the two most important works on the history os doctrine. It marks an epoch
in that history as a inasterly and systematic endeavour to demonstrate that Reformed theology
is not only the theology ol* the New Testamcnt but also that os the Ancient Church.'' (Abcrd.
Quater. Rccord, p. 63, see also p. 509). Bishop Burnet (Life of Bcdcll. 1685, Pres.) describes
it as ¹¹ 3 work which, if he had finished 11, and had been suffered to enjoy the privacies of his
retirement and study to give us the second volume, had been the greatest treasure os theological
learning that perhaps the world has yet seen’'. ¹⁴ Forbes was no ordinary man. and his
writings are no ordinary writings. Distinguished sor his controversial and expository works in
Theology, and for his Ircuicum, called forth by the Scottish ecclesiastica} troubles of the time.
he was no less distinguished sor his Tlecologia Moralis, which is 3 solid treatise on Ethics‚
interpretetl in the light of scripture, and based on the Decalogue, and one that may still be
commended to the consideration os moralists—especially os those who have interest in the
application of ethical principles to lise '' (A bcrd. Qualcr. Studia, p. 74).

Forbes' works were collected and issued in two vols. solio in 1702—3 31 Amsterdam, with a
life by Dr. George Gardcn, which is a mine os ecclesiastica! insorination on the period. For
Garden, 1110 editor, Regem of King's College, minister os St. Machar's‚ and ejected 31 the
Restoration of Presbytery‚ deposed sor Bourignianism (see Lippe's Wodrow, p. 332). For the
share of Forbes in the ⁴ Doctors‘' disputo, see pp. 333, 334 and Shand's Funcrals, p. 7. Con-
siderable dcductions must be made from the glorifications and hyperboles of the party in the
original edition and reprint οἱ 11131 work, and from the prejudiced narratives os Gordon's
Affairs and Spaldingls Trnblcs, followed far too implicitly by uncritical historiatis.
