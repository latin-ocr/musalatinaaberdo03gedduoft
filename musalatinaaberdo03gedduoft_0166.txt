Sic Melvina domus purae Pietatis amorem
Arsit amans, famae ut praescia signa daret.
Nec spes vana fuit, magno virtutis honore
Certatur. Fratrum par prope surgit honos,
5 Auspicia ille dedit felicia, proximus illi
Auxit, qui minimus maior in astra volat.
Hinc Melvina piis caelestis vita Camenis,
Prae istis ut nec ament nectar et ambrosiam.
Hinc Melvina adeo sunt omnia mellea Phoebo,
ιο Non alio ut Phoebus gaudeat ore loqui.

Pastor ealderanus. obiit v. Decmnbris An. 1555.
Arctoo quantum lux sese exporgit in orbe,
Tantum orbi illucet luxque laborque viri.
Virtutum in tenebris quondam lux magna refulsit,
Maior at exorta luce renidet honos.
