GEORGE STRACHAN.

⁴⁴ The surname of Straehan,¹ anciently Strathechin, Strathaquin‚ Strathauchine, etc.‚ is os
great antiquity in Scotland. It is derived from a parish os the same name in Kincardineshire.
We may suppose the family radiating from their original seat into the adjoining districts of
Aberdeenshire to the north, and of Kincardineshire to the south. The name is now rare
among the landed proprietors in either county, although anciently and down to the close of the
seventeenth century it was very common’' (Shand on Forbes's Fiam-ruis, ed. 1845, p. xxvii.).
See Spalding, i. 166, sor the “boundis of Straquhan‚ Drum and Petsoddellis ground; ‘the
Erll Marschallis boundis of Strathauchin,’ '¹ p. 180 and p. 208. The Catholic connection may
be inserted from the James Strachan of the family, found in conjunction with Principal Alex-
ander Anderson (Knox, History, 238, 239; Dempster‚ Hist. Eccl. ii. 597; 1rving, Scotisli
Writers, i. p. 1²5)-

Dempstcr (ii. 601) states all that is known os our author. omitting the list of his works,
which he gives and which does not include the Lachrymct, we may regard what he says as

probable.
“Georgius Strachanus Merniensis, nobili familia, Parisiis humaniores literas docuit in

Cenomanico; ad aulam deinde transiit, et vitae illius pertaesus privatam ei praetulit, tum Duci
Guisio in amicitiam et famulitium se dedit, sed et hanc etiam aspernatus vivendi rationem in
Orientem est profectus, ut linguas Orientales Latinae, Graecae. Hispanicae, Italicae, Gallicae,

et patriae, quas exacte loquebatur ct scribebat, studiose coniungeret.
“ Vivit adhue in Perside, iam enim toto sexennio Terram Sanctam lustravit, et non modo

linguas percepit, sed et nobiliores, ut ad me scribit, bibliothecas compilavit‘' [⁴⁴rifled
libraries:'' scrinia sompilassc: Hor. Sat. i. 1, 122]. He is apparently “a Scotch Jesuit⁹
George Strahan,'' mentioned in Pattison's Casnnbon, p. 215.

TO THE MOST REVEREND WILLIAM CHISHOLM,
BISHOP OF VAISON, AUTHOR OF THE WORK.

The Chisholms were of that ilk in Roxburgh, and of Cromlix, near Dunblane. Three

os the name are known.
1. william Chisholm, Bishop os Dunblane. Consec. 1527; d. 1564 (Tytler, History, ii,

6 .
2. venam Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane; nephew and successor. He was the man

sent by Mary to Franco and Rome to explain away the Bothwell marriage (Eudamum.

¹F0r the spelling of the name in twenty ways, see Lippe's Wodrow, p. 330. Scott knew
the ubiquity os it and its landed connection, when he allies Dugald Dalgetty's estate with
Hannah Strachan, Legend oermtrosc, ch. xxiii.
